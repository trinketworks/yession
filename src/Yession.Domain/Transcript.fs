/// The per-terminal transcript: the durable, append-only record of everything a terminal
/// produced and everything typed into it (Plan 12).
///
/// It is deliberately NOT the event log. The event log records durable *facts* every
/// client folds — a terminal that prints a gigabyte contributes four events there. The
/// bytes themselves go here, to a sidecar file per terminal, because raw output is
/// unmergeable, unfoldable, and unbounded, and putting it in the log would make every
/// client pay the size of what was printed rather than the size of what happened.
///
/// The format is **asciicast v2** (asciinema's): a JSON header line followed by one JSON
/// array per record. That is a deliberate choice of an existing, documented, replayable
/// format over a bespoke one — an operator can hand a `.cast` file to any asciinema
/// player and watch the session back, which is what makes "audited" mean something
/// outside this codebase.
///
/// One extension: asciicast defines `"o"` (output), `"i"` (input) and `"r"` (resize);
/// this adds `"e"` for stderr. A pty cannot tell the two streams apart (that is what a
/// tty *is*), but the piped block runner can, and discarding a distinction the capture
/// actually has — in the one record whose purpose is fidelity — would be the wrong trade.
/// A player that does not know `"e"` skips it; ours renders it.
///
/// The audit trail is the RAW stream, never the rendered screen. ANSI can move the cursor
/// and overwrite what was printed a moment ago, so what a terminal *displays* is a
/// projection with lossy history; what it *emitted* is the record.

///
///   * **Times are absolute.** asciicast timestamps are relative to the start of the FILE,
///     so a block that ran forty minutes in makes the player sit idle for forty minutes
///     before its first frame. The App's `TranscriptReplay.range` rebases them.
///   * **Screen state is path-dependent.** What a terminal shows at line 500 is a function
///     of every byte before it — colours set earlier, cursor position, scroll region,
///     whether something entered the alternate screen. Replaying a slice into a fresh VT is
///     *approximately* right for ordinary command output and wrong exactly when it matters,
///     and it is not close at all for a lease stretch, which by definition begins with a
///     program already owning the screen.
///
/// So the Session serializes the emulator at each range START — every block's
/// `FromSeq`, every lease stretch's — and a ranged replay becomes *header + one synthesized
/// output record that paints this + the rebased range*, which is a valid asciicast the stock
/// player renders with no modification.
///
/// Note what this is **not** for. Keyframes are usually a seek-performance trick, and that
/// was the weaker case: the player rebuilds VT state by re-feeding from `t=0`, which is
/// milliseconds for an ordinary recording. The reason to keep them is *correctness of a
/// ranged replay*, and their cost is bounded by the number of blocks and leases rather than
/// by output volume — the same argument that keeps input and resize records uncapped while
/// output is capped.
