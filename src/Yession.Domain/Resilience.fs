/// Transient-fault handling as ordinary values — what Polly is for .NET, minus the .NET.
/// Nothing in the Polly family can serve this code: it is compiled by Fable and runs in a
/// browser, and every resilience library on NuGet is CLR-only (Polly, Polly.Core, the
/// Microsoft.Extensions.*.Resilience wrappers). So the vocabulary is borrowed and the
/// mechanism is a few small pieces, all but one of them pure:
///
///   * a `Schedule` — attempt number -> how long to wait before the next attempt, `None`
///     to stop. Backoff, capping, and jitter are functions over that, so a retry policy is
///     a VALUE: composable, printable, and testable without an operation to run it against.
///   * a `Verdict` — what one fault says about trying again, which is a decision with three
///     answers rather than two (see the type).
///   * `Policy.guard` and `Policy.deadline` — decorators. Each takes an operation
///     `'a -> Async<Result<'b, 'e>>` and returns the SAME shape, so they compose with `|>`
///     in whatever order a resource wants and stay invisible to every caller downstream.
///
/// Waiting is injected (`Policy.Sleep`), never ambient, and so is jitter's entropy. A test
/// therefore drives a policy through its whole backoff sequence in zero real time — the
/// only way retry logic gets deterministic coverage instead of a sleep and a hope.
