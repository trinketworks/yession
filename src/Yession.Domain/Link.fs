/// Keeping a session link honest: the heartbeat that turns "this transport has silently
/// stopped carrying anything" into the one signal every consumer already handles — a closed
/// channel.
///
/// The gap this closes. A WebRTC data channel can die without saying so: a phone goes into
/// the background, a network switches from WiFi to cellular, a tunnel re-routes. The DTLS
/// association is gone but `readyState` still reads `open`, so sends are accepted into
/// nothing and no `close` event ever fires. Both pumps in this repo react correctly to a
/// channel that CLOSES (the client reconnects and re-pushes its full doc state; the Session
/// runs its cleanup, releasing terminal leases and clearing presence) — they simply
/// never learned that this one had. A message queued on a phone therefore sat on screen
/// until the page was reloaded.
///
/// `Ping`/`Pong` have been in `ControlFrame` since the protocol was written, constructed by
/// nothing and answered by nothing. This is what they were for.
///
/// Three properties are worth stating, because each one is load-bearing:
///
/// * **Death has exactly one expression.** A link that stops answering is CLOSED, and that is
///   all. Nothing above learns about liveness through a second channel, so there is no second
///   state to keep consistent with the first.
/// * **Any inbound frame is proof of life.** A busy link is never probed; only a quiet one
///   is. That keeps the mechanism free where it would cost the most — a terminal streaming
///   output, a turn writing a message — and it is why the tick can afford to be short.
/// * **A heartbeat is invisible above this module.** `Receive` answers an inbound `Ping` and
///   consumes it, and consumes a `Pong`, so neither pump ever sees one. That is not tidiness:
///   `PeerSession.run` rejects any first frame that is not `PeerHello`, and a refused peer
///   PARKS rather than retrying, so a probe racing ahead of the handshake would be fatal.
///   Wrapping both ends makes it unrepresentable.
