/// What a session asks the Manager to send it, when something out on the internet posts to
/// one of the Manager's hook endpoints.
///
/// The Manager relays hooks it cannot read. It verifies that a delivery is signed, matches
/// it against the filters sessions have declared, and forwards it — and at no point does it
/// learn which service sent it, what the event means, or what any field is called. The
/// knowledge stays in the session that declared the filter, which is the only place that
/// has the credential to act on it anyway.
///
/// That is what makes this a FILTER rather than a predicate: a session ships the Manager
/// data, never code. Code would have to be interpreted, the Manager would have to implement
/// every construct the code could contain, and a session upgraded to emit a new one would
/// stop working against an older Manager — making the Manager a version ceiling on the
/// sessions it supervises, which is the opposite of why it is kept ignorant.
///
/// So the language is made small enough to have no versions at all: a conjunction of
/// equalities. Every operator that could be added — a disjunction, a negation, a pattern —
/// is one more thing two builds can disagree about, and equality is the one that cannot be
/// read two ways. There is nothing here to extend, and that is the feature.

/// A path into a delivery, as dotted segments.
///
/// A delivery is addressed as ONE document — `headers.x-github-event` and
/// `body.repository.full_name` are the same kind of path — so the language needs no second
/// form for "look in the headers". Header names are matched lowercased, because HTTP does
/// not promise a case and nothing downstream should have to care.
///
/// Private, so a path cannot exist without having been parsed. A segment containing a dot
/// is not addressable; no provider this serves has one, and inventing an escape now would
/// be a syntax to disagree about later.
