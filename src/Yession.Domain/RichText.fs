// Rich-text bodies. A draft/queue body is a structured ProseMirror document held as a Yjs
// `XmlFragment`. It is a top-level named root on the doc, keyed by `BodyKey`, NOT nested
// inside the `drafts`/`queue` maps and NOT declared in the Ylmish schema, because a custom
// nested in a keyed `Encode.map` cannot round-trip Ylmish's structural decode (it never yields
// `ElCustom`), so the value would never decode anyway. The structural reader skips a fragment
// it meets, so sibling fragment roots sit beside the codec's roots without disturbing a read.
// (It used to walk one as a plain object into its cyclic internals, which was a second reason
// the session document was read by hand; Ylmish 1.0.0-beta0227 retired that one.)
// The body is therefore a CRDT the app co-manages on the doc — synced by the same update
// transport as everything else, and read by the Session Process straight from the doc (it has
// no Ylmish binding). `getXmlFragment key` is idempotent and merges by name, so every replica
// binds the same fragment with no creation race.
//
// A body is structured because the syntax is meant to disappear as you type it. Two cheaper
// shapes were rejected for the same reason: keeping markdown SOURCE in a `Y.Text` and
// decorating it live is boundary-pure but leaves the syntax on screen, and running ProseMirror
// over a `Y.Text` by re-serializing the document to markdown on every keystroke replaces a
// structural merge with a text merge — an impedance mismatch that degrades exactly the
// concurrent editing the CRDT is here for. Markdown remains the interchange format, produced
// only at the edges (`Markdown.ofFragment` at the drain, on paste, and for the read-only
// timeline).

/// Plain text rather than a rich body, because a command line is characters: a shell glob,
