/// store, and resolved back to sessions one value at a time. The Manager never learns
/// WHICH service a credential belongs to: the session chooses the storage name and
/// supplies provider endpoints as data; everything here is service-agnostic.

/// Who a connection credential belongs to when it is signed in for "all my sessions".
/// Still NO anonymous case: every owner here is one the Manager verified. An attributed
/// deployment owns by user; an unattributed one owns by `LocalOwner` — not a pseudo-user
/// invented for the occasion, but the single principal `--auth localhost` actually grants,
/// authorized against the unattributed access the Manager recorded for that launch.

/// It is deliberately NOT the browser peer. A peer id lives in origin-partitioned
/// localStorage, so it changes under the person holding it — a new origin, a cleared
/// store, a second device — and each new id used to strand the credential behind it. An
/// owner has to outlive the browser that named it.
