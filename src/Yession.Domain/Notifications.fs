/// of the control channel, NO session content travels here — only what the Manager owns
/// or receives on the session's behalf and the session could not otherwise learn about.
///
/// The Session hands each notification to a `NotificationHandler`, which dispatches
/// it into the process loop and MAY record a durable `SessionEvent` (so the change reaches
/// clients and the agent's next context) — or re-drain, or ignore it. It is never obliged
/// to: a notification is a signal, not a durable fact.

    ///
    /// The Manager forwards it without having read it: it checked the signature over the
    /// bytes, resolved the paths the session's own filter named, and passed the delivery
    /// on. `Endpoint` is which of its hook endpoints took it in — the unit an operator
    /// configures a secret and a signature scheme for — and `Subscription` is which of
    /// this session's filters matched, so the session dispatches without matching again.

    /// Headers ride with the body because a delivery IS both: the event type lives in a
    /// header for most providers, so a relay that dropped them would be lossy about the
    /// message rather than tidy about metadata.
