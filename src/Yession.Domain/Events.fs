    // folds stays the size of what happened rather than the size of what was printed.
    // The block events bracket the transcript range they produced (`FromSeq`/`ToSeq`),
    // which is how "who ran this, and which bytes are its output" is answerable from the

    // A declaration that did NOT become a sandbox (Plan 27). The sibling above announces the

    | RepoConfigRefused of RepoConfigRefused
    // What a repo's file asks for, said when it CHANGES. A capability set is authored by

    // a store is not a decision anybody wants to be asked to make.

    // The shell profile (Plan 25): where a shell opened in one sandbox starts. One event
    // for set and for clear, because "what does a new terminal do" has one answer at a
    // time — a second verb would let the two disagree about which was last.
    | ShellProfileSet of ShellProfileSet
    // The approval gate's refusal (Plan 15, stage 3). Only the refusal: an approval is
    // recorded on the event of the command it released.
    | CommandRefused of CommandRefused
    // Its sibling: released, run, and failed — recorded only for an author that has no tool
    // result to read the failure from.
    | GatedCommandFailed of GatedCommandFailed
    // Tool use (Plan 16, part C): every call the agent makes, recorded. Two events rather
    // than one, and for the same reason a block has two — a call that takes four minutes
    // must hold its place in the chat WHILE it is the only thing happening, so the start
    // anchors it and the finish moves what it says without touching where it sits.
    //
    // These fold into the TIMELINE and deliberately not into `ConversationProjection`: the
    // agent made the call and already has the result in its own transcript, so feeding it
    // back would double-feed the model. That is the same rule terminals follow, and the
    // opposite of the one repos follow — the question is not "did the agent do it" but
    // "does a future turn need to be told?".
    | ToolUseStarted of ToolUseStarted
    | ToolUseFinished of ToolUseFinished
    // The MCP servers this session was given (Plan 17). With no attach step there is no
    // human act to record — but the SESSION still gains and loses whole namespaces of
    // tools while it runs, and a turn that suddenly has four serial tools it did not have
    // before needs to know why. So the question part C asked applies: not "did the agent
    // do it" but "does a future turn need to be told?".

    // on the watcher's behalf (envelope actor System, watcher on the payload). The
    // watch's Initial snapshot plus the recorded transitions ARE the detection baseline
    // (`PrWatches.fs`), which is what keeps a restart from re-announcing old news.
