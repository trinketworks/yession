/// Terminals, projected from the event log (Plan 12). Like the conversation, this
/// is a pure fold over ordered events and nothing else — never the doc, never live
/// output. That is what makes the terminal list, its blocks, and their exit codes
/// identical on every replica and after every reload, and it is why there is no way for a
/// client to invent a block: the only constructor is an event the Session Process wrote.
///
/// The bytes a block printed are NOT here. They live in the terminal's transcript
/// (`Transcript.fs`); a block records the transcript range it produced, and a renderer
/// joins the two. The split is the whole design: facts fold, bytes stream.

// The gate a command passes on its way to running is the classifier (Classify.fs) — one
// seam, shared with every other gated act, because nothing about deciding whether an act
// may happen is terminal-shaped.

/// What a client has just learned about how far a terminal's transcript has got.
///
/// The two cases carry different UNITS, and that is the entire reason this type exists.
/// `RecordAt` is an INDEX — the seq a live record arrived at. `AvailableLength` is a COUNT —
/// how many lines the feed says the transcript holds. A client asking "is there something I
/// have not read?" therefore needs `>=` for one and `>` for the other, against the same read
/// position.
///
/// That comparison used to be made at each call site, and one of them made it with the wrong
/// operator: `readPositionOf` is the NEXT unread line, so a live record arriving at exactly
/// that seq IS unread, and `>` skipped it. For a terminal opened mid-session that path is the
/// only trigger to fetch history — the availability hint is sent once, at accept — so the
/// LAST record, the shell's output with nothing following to push the stream ahead, was shown
/// live and never fetched to the store. A reload replayed the command with no output. It only
/// ever failed on a loaded runner, because a slow local drain left the read position behind
/// and hid it.
///
/// So the units live in the type and the rule lives with the cursor. A caller says what it
/// SAW; it does not do arithmetic about somebody else's read position.

    ///     yank the keyboard from a peer who had taken the terminal explicitly and happened
    ///     to run an editor in it.
    ///   * The flip follows the AUTHOR, and the agent is one (Plan 20, stage 6). This rule
    ///     used to read "an agent-authored block does not flip — live mode is human-only",
    ///     which was true of a session where the agent had no hands: live mode was a browser
    ///     surface, so handing it a terminal would have handed it to nobody. Plan 19 gave it
    ///     `write_terminal`/`read_terminal`, and what the exception left behind was a wedge —
    ///     an agent command that takes the screen waits for a keystroke nobody is allowed to
    ///     send, so its block never finishes and the queue behind it never moves. Nothing
    ///     flips to `SessionProcess`, `System` or a repo's file, and that is not policy

/// Who may type raw bytes into an INSTRUMENTED terminal — one whose commands are blocks.
///
/// The rule the admission asks, kept apart from the write that applies it. Blocks exist so
/// that what runs is classified and on the record, and raw bytes into the shell would be
/// the door around that — so nobody types into a shell terminal at large. Two parties are
/// admitted, and both are typing into something already on the record rather than running
/// something new:
///
///   * the LEASE HOLDER — detection handed them the terminal over a block that took the
///     alternate screen (`Flip`), and their keystrokes are that block's;
///   * the AUTHOR OF THE RUNNING BLOCK — the block is theirs, classified and recorded, and a
///     command that prompts is waiting on exactly them. Without this an agent's block that
///     asked for stdin (`BlockStdinPolicy`) had stdin and no hand to feed it with, and a
///     block of its that turned out to be stuck could be ended only by closing the whole
///     terminal, `cd` and all.
///
/// Neither admits typing while NOTHING runs: between blocks the shell is at its prompt, and
/// bytes typed there would be a command that skipped the queue.
