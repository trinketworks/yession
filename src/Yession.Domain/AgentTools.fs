// This is the `yession` namespace: the verbs a turn has always had, moved off the
// runner's parameter list and onto a value. They live in the domain rather than beside the
// SDK adapter for one reason worth stating — what a tool ANSWERS is the interesting part,
// and it is now testable without a model, a subprocess or a browser. The adapter is left
// with the thing only it can do: turning descriptors into SDK tools.
//
// The wire names are unchanged (`mcp__yession__execute_command`, …) because the namespace
// is the SDK server's name and the server was already called `yession`.
