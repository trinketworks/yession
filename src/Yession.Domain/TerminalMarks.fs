/// OSC 133 semantic marks: how the Session Process learns where a block starts, where it
/// ends, and with what code (Plan 13, stage 2d).
///
/// The marks are emitted by the shell's own prompt hooks — not by a sentinel the drain
/// appends to the command line. A sentinel is the tempting cheaper mechanism and it is wrong
/// for ordinary command lines a person is invited to type and edit: a trailing comment
/// (`ls # check`) swallows it, a heredoc puts it on the delimiter line, a trailing `&`
/// changes what `$?` refers to. Repairing that lands a parser for shell grammar in the
/// drain, which fails silently as a block that never closes.
///
/// EVERY MARK CARRIES A NONCE, and that is the whole of the integrity story. `ESC ] 133 ; D
/// ; 0 BEL` is a dozen bytes of ASCII and the output stream is full of bytes we did not
/// write — a file someone `cat`s, a build log, a filename. Here a mark is not a rendering
/// nicety: it writes the event log. A forged `D` would close the running block early with an
/// exit code nobody produced and a truncated transcript range — a failed command recorded as
/// successful, in the record that exists to be trusted. So a mark without this terminal's
/// nonce is not a mark; it is bytes that happen to look like one, and it stays in the output.
///
/// Warp, whose block model this is, does not use OSC 133 for boundaries at all: it carries
/// hex-encoded JSON on a private DCS channel, because it must move USER DATA out of a shell it
/// does not control — a cwd or a PS1 containing `ESC` would otherwise terminate the sequence
/// carrying it. We need none of that. The drain COMPOSED the command line and already recorded
/// it in `TerminalBlockStarted`, so all that has to come back is "it started" and "it finished,
/// with this code" — which is exactly what `C` and `D` say, and what
/// `registerOscHandler(133, …)` reads without a parser of ours. Anything richer means
/// encoding, and encoding means a payload.

/// name is a caller that can get it wrong somewhere no cheap test reaches:
///
///   * The drain completes a block on a `D`. bash arms `PS1`/`PROMPT_COMMAND` and then types
///     several more rc lines (`__y_armed=1`, `trap … DEBUG`), each ending in a prompt cycle
///     whose `PROMPT_COMMAND` emits a `D`. The open-probe returns on the first `A`, so those
///     stale `D`s are still in flight when the first real block runs — and a `D` accepted
///     without this block's `C` closes it early, with an exit code that is not the command's.
///     Requiring a start-mark first is what tells this block's completion from a leftover
///     prompt. A dialect with no `C` (POSIX sh) has nothing to wait for and completes on `D`
///     alone — which is safe there, because its single rc line leaves exactly one prompt and
///     the probe consumes it.
///   * The integration detector is "a start-mark that did not arrive". A dialect that never
///     emits one must not arm it, or every command slower than the window reports a working
