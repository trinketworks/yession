/// It is a parser, not an emulator. It answers "what does this output *say*", which is
/// what a block of command output needs; it does not maintain a screen, a cursor grid,
/// or an alternate buffer, which is what a full-screen program needs (that arrives with
/// the pty, where a real emulator does the job properly). The line between the two is
/// deliberate: half an emulator would be a worse emulator and a worse parser.

/// The line is drawn at what a STREAM can say exactly, and two things are on this side of
/// it. A carriage return rewrites the line being written. A cursor-forward moves right over
/// cells nothing has written, which is a run of blanks under any emulator — and it is here
/// because this renders the LIVE SCREEN too, and a serialized screen is mostly that: the
/// emulator writes every gap between two pieces of content as `ESC[nC`. Everything past
/// that boundary — the other cursor moves, the erases — needs a grid to mean anything, and
/// is dropped.
