// A stream a provider offers becomes a terminal (Plan 19).
//
// This is the whole of the extension point, and it is deliberately small: a tool result may
// carry a `StreamOffer`, and an offer becomes a terminal people can see and type into.
// Nothing here — and nothing anywhere else in the product — knows what is on the other end
// of the stream. A serial device, a board's console, a shell on another host and a CI runner
// are the same fact to this file: bytes, and a declaration of what else they can do.
//
// A DECORATOR over the registry rather than a branch inside the MCP client, for the reason
// `ToolUseLog` is one: every call the agent makes goes through `InvokeTool`, in-process and
// proxied alike, so a seam here cannot be bypassed by a tool that arrives later.
//
// What a provider has to do to be heard here — the offer, its admission, and the wire behind
// the url — is `docs/streams.md`.
//
// An offer opens a terminal automatically, and there is deliberately no `attach_stream` tool
// for the agent to call afterwards. An offer is already a provider's answer to a call somebody
// made on purpose; a second step in which the agent asks for the thing it was just handed is
// the selection layer the MCP configuration work deleted twice — a step that only ever gets
// performed. A provider that does not want a terminal opened does not offer one, and that knob
// is on the side that knows.
