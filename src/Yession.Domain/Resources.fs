// The operator's vocabulary, and the algebra that flattens it.
//
// A sandbox is granted things. This module is about WHICH things, said in a way that has
// exactly two authors and no third: the operator NAMES what this host can offer, and a repo
// SELECTS from those names. Nothing here knows what npm is, or nix, or a toolchain — the
// five primitives below are the whole vocabulary, and a sixth ecosystem is a change to an
// operator's file rather than a release of this program.
//
// The point of separating it is that flattening a selection is where the interesting
// mistakes live — a cycle, a diamond, two grants that cannot both hold, a dangerous grant
// hidden inside a friendly name — and every one of them is decidable without touching a
// filesystem. So this module has no IO, no env, no paths it resolves, and no backend. It
// runs in the cheap tier on both runtimes, which is what lets the properties below be the
// thing that is believed rather than a later end-to-end run.
//
// What flattening PRODUCES is used three ways, and it matters that it is one set and not
// three: it is bound-checked against what the operator declared, shown to a human who is
// deciding whether to allow it, and handed to a backend to materialise. A prompt that shows
// one thing while a backend materialises another is the failure this shape exists to make
// unrepresentable.

/// Whether the operator marked a leaf as one a person should be told about.
///
/// A join semilattice with `Sensitive` on top, and that IS the masking defence: nothing in
/// this module lowers a value, so there is no operation an operator could reach for that
/// would quiet a leaf by wrapping it in something friendlier.
