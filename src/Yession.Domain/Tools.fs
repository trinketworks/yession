// The agent's tools, as DATA (Plan 16, part A).
//
// They used to be code: twelve `sdk.tool(...)` calls written out inside one `[<Emit>]`
// template literal, a runner taking one positional callback per tool, and a literal list of
// wire names beside them that had to be kept in step by hand. Adding a tool cost an edit in
// three places and a parameter on a function that already had eighteen; adding a tool at RUN
// time — which is what a session-declared MCP server is — was not expensive, it was
// impossible.
//
// So a tool becomes a descriptor plus one dispatch function. The runner builds the SDK's
// tools in a loop, computes the auto-approve list from the same descriptors, and never
// learns what any individual tool does. Everything downstream of that — a proxied external
// server, a tool-use record that names where a call went — is then an ordinary consumer of
// the same two values.
