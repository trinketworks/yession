// Where a terminal's bytes come from (Plan 16, part D).
//
// A terminal is an emulator, a transcript, a lease and a panel OVER A BYTE STREAM. Until
// now that stream always came from `Sandbox.SpawnPty`, and the open path called it directly
// — so "terminal" and "shell in this session's WorkSandbox" were the same thing by
// construction rather than by choice.
//
// They are not the same thing. A serial port is a byte stream; so is a pty on another host,
// a CI runner, a container somewhere else. What separates them is not WHERE they come from
// but WHAT THEY CAN DO, and that is worth declaring rather than discovering: a source that
// cannot be instrumented should say so at open, not at the third command.

/// What a source can do, declared by whoever produced it.
///
/// Declared the way `Sandbox.SpawnPty : … option` already declares pty support — a backend
/// saying up front what it cannot host, rather than failing the first time somebody needs
/// it. The three are genuinely independent: a serial line has no size and no exit code but
/// carries bytes perfectly well, and a remote shell may have all three.
///
/// What each one buys the provider that claims it is in `docs/streams.md`.
