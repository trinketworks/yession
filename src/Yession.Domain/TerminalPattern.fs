// Matching a pattern against what a terminal said (Plan 25, step 9).
//
// This exists because the obvious thing is not available. A regular expression here would be
// a JS `RegExp` — the Session is Fable on Node — and JS has no match timeout. A
// catastrophic pattern would not fail a turn, it would wedge the event loop that owns every
// terminal in the session, the Yjs document and the WebRTC pump. .NET's `Regex` takes a
// `MatchTimeout`; the runtime this actually runs on does not. So "use a regex and bound it"
// is not an option, and that — rather than any squeamishness about what a model might write —
// is why the first cut of `wait_for` took literal text only.
//
// What IS available is a matcher that cannot blow up, rather than one we hope will not.
// Thompson's construction compiles the pattern to a small instruction list and simulates ALL
// live states at once, so the cost is O(pattern x input) with no backtracking and no stack.
// `(a+)+$` against a long run of `a` is the case that hangs a backtracking engine and is
// merely a match here; there is a test that says so.
//
// The subset is small on purpose. Backreferences cannot be simulated this way at all, and
// lookaround and non-greedy quantifiers could be but would each buy one more thing a caller
// has to learn. They are refused BY NAME, so the subset is learnable rather than guessable.
