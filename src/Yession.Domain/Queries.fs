// The query vocabulary (Plan 15): the READ half of the session's imperative API,
// declared once so that one declaration reaches two audiences — the agent (as an MCP
// tool carrying `readOnlyHint`) and the human (as a generated read-only settings
// surface). Nobody writes a panel for a new query; registering it is what puts it on
// the screen.
//
// Three properties make that possible, and all three are enforced here rather than by
// convention:
//
// - **Nullary.** A query takes no arguments. A parameterised read needs a form, a form
//   is an input, and an input on a read-only surface is a command in disguise
//   (`repo_status octo/hello` is a fine agent tool and deliberately NOT a query).
// - **Read-only.** Declared, not inferred — the MCP annotation is the spec's own marker,
//   so identifying queries in a THIRD-PARTY server needs no yession-specific convention.
// - **Shape-declared.** A query says whether it answers with rows, fields, or a single
//   value, so one renderer can draw all of them and the accessibility floor is
//   implemented once instead of once per panel.
