module Yession.Domain.Cli

// What each bin accepts on its command line, declared as data and parsed by Node's own
// `parseArgs` (`node:util`) — a real parser, with no dependency to add, because these bins
// already run on Node.
//
// It replaces hand-rolled `process.argv` scanning, which got two things wrong that matter
// more than the parsing itself:
//
//   - An unknown option was SILENTLY IGNORED. `yession-manager --auht localhost` ran with
//     no strategy at all, which is deny-everything — a typo that looks like a hang. Under
//     `strict`, `parseArgs` refuses instead.
//   - A bad value threw at module init, inside Fable's async, and surfaced as
//     `UnhandledPromiseRejection ... "[object Object]"` — technically a refused boot, but
//     nothing an operator could act on. `parseOrExit` prints the reason and the usage.
//
// Argu would be the F# answer on .NET and cannot be the answer here: Fable compiles from
// F# SOURCE, so a package has to ship its source files to be usable at all, and Argu ships
// IL. Its DU-plus-attributes model leans on reflection besides.
//
// The typed-access property Argu is loved for survives, by a different route: an `Opt` is a
// VALUE, and reading a parse back takes the same value that declared the option. There is
// no name to mistype at the call site, and an option cannot be read unless it was declared.
