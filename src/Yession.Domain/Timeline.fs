/// The chat as a PERSON reads it (Plan 14, stage 1): what was said and what was run, in the
/// order it happened.
///
/// This is a view-level merge, not a fold that competes with the two it merges.
/// `ConversationProjection` stays exactly what it was — it is the agent's context, and the
/// agent already gets block outcomes through `Digest` — and `Projection`
/// stays the terminals' own structure. Both are folds of the SAME ordered event log, which
/// is what makes combining them a sort by `EventOffset` rather than a reconciliation of two
/// clocks.
///
/// **The consequence, stated rather than discovered later:** the human's chat and the
/// agent's chat diverge. A person scrolling back sees twelve commands the agent's context
/// does not contain in that form. That is the trade — the digest gives the agent bounded
/// outcomes, the chat gives a person the shape of what happened — but "what is in the
/// conversation" now has two answers depending on who is asking.
///
/// **The unit is the block or the lease stretch, never the terminal.** Blocks exist only in
/// block mode and lease stretches only in live mode, so the two TILE a terminal's timeline:
/// no overlap, no gap, and therefore no "was this a long session?" threshold to tune. A
/// terminal that starts as a shell, becomes a `vim` session and returns to a prompt
/// contributes chips, then one stretch item, then more chips, and each of them is true.

/// One stretch of live mode: from the moment an actor took a terminal's stdin to the moment
/// that lease ended.
///
/// Assembled here rather than projected into `Projection` because it is not a fact
/// about a terminal's current state — a terminal has ONE lease and it is either held or not.
/// A stretch is a fact about the past, and it is the past that the chat shows.
