// What a repo asks a session for (`yession.yaml`, Plan 27).
//
// The whole file is SANDBOXES, and that is the design rather than a starting point. The
// constraint is a complete algebra: every key needs a defined answer for "two repos both
// said something", and a sandbox is the only scope where that answer is TOTAL — it is
// named, and the name is scoped to its repo (`SandboxScope`), so the union of two files is
// disjoint by construction. No precedence rule, nothing shadows anything.
//
// So the rule for every future key: a key belongs here only if its scope is a sandbox.
// Anything session-wide (approval gates, MCP servers, a dependency on another repo) has no
// honest tie-break between two repos that disagree, and stays the operator's.
//
// This module is PURE and parser-free. It decodes an already-parsed JSON tree, which is
// what lets the whole of it — every refusal included — run in the cheap tier on both
// runtimes from JSON literals. YAML is a superset of JSON, so the bridge that reads the
// file only has to hand this a tree; swapping the surface syntax later is a parser swap.
