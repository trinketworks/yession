/// The client's visual language, authored entirely in F# by composing Tailwind's own
/// utility classes into typed, named values. Tailwind supplies the utilities; F# supplies
/// the composition; the TOKENS — palette, type ramp, caps tracking, structural spacing,
/// fonts, keyframes — live in the `@theme` block of `app/tailwind.css`, and nothing here
/// carries a raw hex or a structural pixel count that has a token.
///
/// The design is Metro / Zune (pre-Windows 8) worn by a Slack/Cursor workspace anatomy.
/// Zune's own panorama — horizontal surfaces you pan between — was considered for the whole
/// shell and rejected: it is a media-browsing metaphor, and the job here is watching one
/// conversation, editing a queue, and intervening fast. The session is one room, and
/// navigation through it is vertical time, not horizontal space. Zune survives in the type,
/// the colour and the motion, and the pivot idiom survives at exactly one scale — the
/// sidebar's two destinations (`navPivot`), which are a place you go, not a surface you pan.
///
/// The rules that keep it coherent:
///
///   Type grid — everything sits on a 4px baseline rhythm, as paired size/line tokens:
///     label 11/16 · small 13/16 · body 15/24 · pivot 19/24 · heading 28/32 ·
///     wordmark 32/36 (px), plus the mono pair code 12/16 · code-sm 11/16.
///   The sidebar wordmark and the main header share one band (`h-band`, items-end,
///   common bottom padding) so their baselines align across the hairline.
///
///   Affordance — statuses are TEXT (colored caps, at most a small dot; never filled,
///   never boxed). Buttons are bordered Metro rectangles (transparent; hover brightens
///   the border; press fills solid). Nothing else carries a border.
///
///   Strokes — every border in the product is composed from the `Stroke` vocabulary
///   below (width, tone, and what interaction does to it) into a handful of phrases —
///   `field`/`fieldSelect`/`fieldBare`, `rowBase`/`rowLift`, `focusRing` — and those
///   phrases are what surfaces wear. No bare `border-*` utility is written outside
///   `Stroke`, and none at all in the views. The two remaining literals are variant-
///   PREFIXED (`md:[.nav-alt_&]:border-r-0`), undoing a column's divider while it is
///   shut: the variant is part of the class name, so there is no token to compose.
///
///   Colour — technocool: blue is interactive and the agent's voice; green is live/ok
///   and the human pulse. People are identified by tiny square display pics, not name
///   colours. The blue→green gradient appears exactly ONCE: the composer's focus edge.

    // --- Strokes: the border vocabulary every bordered thing is built from ---------------
    //
    // A stroke is three independent choices — a WIDTH, a TONE at rest, and what happens
    // under interaction — and naming the three separately is what stops a settings field,
    // a queued row and a terminal composer from each inventing their own. Nothing below
    // this section writes a `border-*` utility directly; it composes these.
    //
    // Two widths, and only two:
    //   `ring` — 1px on all four sides. What you TYPE IN or PRESS (fields, buttons).
    //   `lead` — 2px on the leading edge. What is LISTED where two states share one surface
    //            (the terminal's queued commands, a collaborator's collapsed draft) and the
    //            edge says what the row IS. The message queue is NOT one of these any more:
    //            its rows are bands in the composer's dock (see `queueItem`).
    //   `underline` — the single exception, and it is a shape not a third width: a heading
    //            that edits in place (the session title), where a rectangle drawn round
    //            28px type reads as a box rather than a field.
    //
    // Two rules keep the states honest, and they are opposites on purpose:
    //   * A RING answers to INTERACTION. It brightens on hover and goes blue while
    //     focused — every field, every button, no exceptions. Blue is interactive, and
    //     focus is the most interactive a thing gets.
    //   * A LEAD answers to the MODEL and never to the pointer: green = live and still
    //     editable, blue = waiting on you, err = wrong, a peer's colour = whose it is.
    //     Interaction lifts the SURFACE instead (`rowLift`), so a row's tone can never be
