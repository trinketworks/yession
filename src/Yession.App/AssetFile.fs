/// Every static file a build ships, declared once — the case, its path, and what its bytes
/// ARE. Three consumers read this and nothing else: `tasks.fsx` (which produces each file),
/// `Assets` (which reads and serves them), and the documents that link them. Each consumer
/// matches over the type, so adding a file is a compile error everywhere until it is handled.
/// That is the point of a union here rather than a directory listing: the build cannot ship
/// what the server will not serve, and the server cannot claim what the build does not ship.
///
/// This does NOT make one process's set another's business. A session upgraded on its own has
/// its own binary, so its own declaration, and serves faces this Manager has never heard of —
/// the route (`SessionRoute.Asset`) still carries a path and nothing more. What is exhaustive
/// is a build against ITSELF.
///
/// The identifier would be the file name if F# allowed it. It does not: `.` and `/` are
/// invalid in a union case even inside backticks (FS0883), and a lowercase case needs
/// `RequireQualifiedAccess` (FS0053, which is why the attribute is here). So the case is the
/// backticked stem, and the name lives exactly once — in `describe`, beside the content type,
/// because the two are one fact. Telling a browser the wrong thing about bytes is the same
/// class of bug as serving the wrong bytes: a stylesheet that is not `text/css` is DROPPED by
/// a standards-mode document, and a module script at a non-JS type is refused outright.
