/// has content.
///
/// The slot is what every OTHER client renders a draft box from, so publishing one when the
/// composer mounted — what the browser used to do — put an empty box on every peer's composer
/// for everyone who had ever opened the session, and left the slot in the doc forever after they
/// left. Publication follows the body instead: the first keystroke materialises the slot,
/// emptying the body retracts it.
///
/// Nothing else has to change, because the body is NOT inside the slot: it is a top-level
/// fragment root (RichText.fs) that exists independently, so the local composer still mounts and
/// types before any slot exists — and a send, which removes the slot, still carries the body over.
