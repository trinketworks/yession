/// The shell as an INSTALLABLE app — the web manifest, the icon, and the head tags that make
/// a browser offer "add to home screen" and then launch this without its chrome.
///
/// Why it is here and not in a static file: a session does not necessarily own the root of
/// its origin (an operator's proxy may mount it under a path — Plan 09), so both the
/// manifest and every URL inside it have to be relative, and the icon has to come from a
/// process that may be serving from a store path with no assets directory beside it. The
/// icon is therefore a constant in the binary, like every other thing the shell needs to be
/// self-contained (`Style.headTags`, the inline nav script): no CDN, no sidecar file.
///
/// What each tag is for, because they overlap and it is easy to add a fourth that says the
/// same thing again:
///   * `manifest` — the standard declaration. `display: standalone` is what drops the
///     browser's chrome, and Android/desktop Chrome read it to offer an install.
///   * `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` — the SAME statement to a browser that does not read
///     the manifest (iOS before 16.4). Not a fallback beside a primary: it is the only place
///     those versions look, and the manifest is the only place newer ones do.
///   * `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style: black` — the status bar over a black app. The
///     `black-translucent` variant would put the app UNDER the clock, which then needs
///     safe-area insets on every fixed panel; `black` keeps the system bars as system bars.
///   * `theme-color` — what the browser tints its own bars with BEFORE anyone installs
///     anything, which is most of the value on a phone: the address bar stops being a light
///     slab over a black product.
