/// Where a stroke sits on the chapter rail, given where the message it opens at actually is.
///
/// The rail used to be an INDEX: strokes spaced by rank on a log scale, so a stroke was never
/// level with the message it pointed at. That was defensible on its own and unreadable beside
/// the per-item controls it shared a margin with — two columns of near-identical dashes, one
/// placed by the conversation and one by arithmetic, and nothing on the screen saying which
/// was which.
///
/// So it is a MAP where it can be and an index where it cannot. Read as one function of how
/// far a message's top sits above the fold:
///
///   in the exact zone   the stroke is level with the message, to the pixel
///   above it            eased, asymptotically to the rail's top
///   below the fold      the same easing mirrored, into a band at the rail's foot
///
/// The two easings share a shape — `budget * (1 - e^(-travel/budget))` — chosen because it
/// covers an unbounded travel in `budget` pixels AND arrives with a derivative of exactly 1.
/// That second property is what makes both seams invisible: a stroke leaving the exact zone
/// begins to lag rather than jumping, so scrolling moves the rail continuously.
///
/// Nothing here knows what a message or a scrollport is. It is arithmetic, and it lives where
/// a cheap test can reach it rather than in the browser layer that measures its inputs — the
/// measuring is three lines, and this is the part that can be wrong.

    ///
    /// It is also the reason the exact zone can be exact. A stroke's own place is measured
    /// from the rail's bottom, so a band reserved under the exact zone would shift every
    /// stroke in it by exactly this much — unless the zone starts here, which is what the

    /// describes.

    /// promise covers the whole reading area — including the middle, which is where the rail's
