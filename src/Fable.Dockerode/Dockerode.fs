module Fable.Dockerode

// Fable bindings to the `dockerode` npm package — the de-facto Node client for the Docker
// Engine API (Docker ships no official Node SDK; only Go and Python are official). This is
// the binding layer only, mirroring how `Fable.Yjs` wraps `yjs`: it declares the slice of
// dockerode's surface the Docker backend uses and nothing more. The engine lives behind
// the sandbox seam (`CreateSandbox`), so nothing above this file knows dockerode exists.
//
// Fable-only: `dotnet build` type-checks it; Fable emits the JS that runs on Node. Methods
// that return promises surface as `JS.Promise<_>` for `Async.AwaitPromise` at the call site.
