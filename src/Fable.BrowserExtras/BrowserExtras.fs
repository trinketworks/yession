namespace Fable.BrowserExtras

// Bindings for the browser's `ResizeObserver`: a callback when an element's BOX changes,
// however it changed — a stylesheet, a parent's layout, a custom property, the window. That
// last clause is the whole reason to want one, because it is exactly the set of changes no
// render loop can see: nothing was dispatched, so nothing re-measured.
//
// Declared here rather than reached for with an `[<Emit>]` at the call site for the reason
// every binding in this repository is: an emit body is inlined into whatever calls it, so it
// is invisible to a reader of that file, unreachable from any other, and — the sharp edge —
// Fable does not treat a change to one as a change to its callers. Editing an emit leaves
// every compiled caller stale, which reads as a test failing for a reason the source does not
// contain. A binding project has none of those problems: it is a module, so it recompiles what
// depends on it.
//
// Only the slice actually used is declared. `ResizeObserverEntry` carries `contentRect`,
// `borderBoxSize` and friends; nothing here reads them, because the callback's value is that
// it FIRED — what the new size is gets measured from the element the same way it is measured
// on any other pass, so a second source for it could only disagree.
