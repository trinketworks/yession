// Bindings for `@napi-rs/keyring` (the Rust `keyring-rs` behind N-API): the OS
// credential managers — macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret
// Service — behind one `Entry`. This declares only the slice the Manager's KeyStore
// uses and nothing more; nothing above that seam knows the library exists. The npm
// package ships per-platform prebuilds as plain registry-hosted optionalDependencies,
// so it loads without a build step wherever npm resolved it.
