  # dbus + gnome-keyring back the `Keyring` test capability on headless LINUX hosts:
  # `check Keyring` re-execs itself under a private, empty-password-unlocked Secret
  # Service when no session bus exists (see tasks.fsx keyringWrapper).
  #
  # Linux-only, and not as a preference — gnome-keyring has no darwin build, so listing it
  # unconditionally made the whole shell fail to EVALUATE on macOS ("Refusing to evaluate
  # package 'gnome-keyring' … not available on the requested hostPlatform"). Not a broken
  # test: `nix develop` could not be entered at all, so nothing on a Mac could reach the
  # toolchain through the documented path.
  #
  # Nothing is lost there. `needsKeyringWrap` (tasks.fsx) is gated on `IsLinux`, because a
  # desktop already has a Secret Service — the real Keychain — and `check Keyring` drives
  # that instead. The wrapper exists for hosts with no session bus, which macOS never is.
  #
  # bubblewrap + socat + ripgrep are the srt backend's Linux dependencies (and back the `Srt`
  # test capability). bubblewrap and socat are Linux-only for the same reason gnome-keyring is:
  # no darwin build, and macOS confines with Seatbelt, which ships with the OS. ripgrep is
  # listed with them because it is the same story — srt scans for its mandatory denies with it,
  # on Linux only.
  #
  # eudev backs the `Serial` capability alongside socat, and is Linux-only because the need
  # is: `SerialPort.list()` shells out to `udevadm` on Linux to learn a port's vendor and
  # product, and without it enumeration throws rather than answering. eudev rather than
  # systemd because it is the standalone udev — its `udevadm info` answers from sysfs with no
  # daemon running, which a container has none of. socat is what makes the rest testable with
  # no hardware: a PTY pair is a serial port at both ends.
  # uv + a CPython back the `Jumpstarter` capability: the jumpstarter example is a uv project,
  # and the suite that drives it runs `uv run --project`. UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=never below is
  # what makes this interpreter the one it uses — otherwise uv fetches an interpreter of its
  # own, which is a second, unpinned toolchain arriving over the network mid-run.
  #
  # caddy backs the `Caddy` capability: the fronted-deployment E2E runs the proxy example's
  # own Caddyfile (examples/proxy/caddy) in front of a real Manager, so the file the README
  # tells an operator to deploy is the file the suite drives.

  # tidiness. That command reached outside the build: `--with-deps` installs SYSTEM packages
  # (apt, as root) as a side effect of running tests, which works on a CI image and on nothing
  # else. nixpkgs instead patchelfs the same upstream build against an explicit X/GTK/NSS
  # closure and wraps it with SSL_CERT_FILE and FONTCONFIG_FILE, so on Linux it needs neither
  # apt nor root; on darwin it is the same app bundle Playwright would have downloaded, where
  # `--with-deps` was never anything but a no-op.
  #
  # Same browser either way: this nixpkgs pins playwright-driver 1.61.1 — the exact version
  # tasks.fsx pinned for npx, and the pair Microsoft.Playwright 1.61.0 expects. That agreement
