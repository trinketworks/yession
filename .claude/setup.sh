# Every egress from this container is TLS-intercepted, and the proxy's CA lives in the

# sandboxed with SSL_CERT_FILE pinned to nixpkgs' \`cacert\` (Mozilla roots only), and no
# impure env var can override it from out here. So a builder that connects DIRECT gets the
# interception certificate, fails to validate it, and dies with curl 60.
#
# Going through the proxy is the path that works: it CONNECTs straight through to hosts like
# registry.npmjs.org without intercepting them, so the real certificate arrives and the
# Mozilla roots accept it. The ambient no_proxy — which names registry.npmjs.org — pushes
# builders off exactly that path, and this wrapper inherits the caller's environment, so it
# has to be unset rather than merely not set.

# The symptom this fixes is the npm tarball fetches being unable to fetch anything, which made

# devenv rewrites devenv.lock on every run, re-adding a `devenv` node that names THIS
# container's /nix/store path (see .gitignore for why the committed lock carries nixpkgs only).
# That left a tracked file permanently modified: noise in every `git status`, and one
# `git commit -a` away from pinning the repo's devenv input to a path no other checkout has.
#
# A clean filter states what is actually true — that node is not part of the file's TRACKED
# content — so git hashes the working copy without it and the file matches HEAD. Local to this
# clone (`.git/info/attributes`, never the committed `.gitattributes`), so a laptop or CI
# checkout is untouched by any of it. An upstream nixpkgs bump still shows, still merges.
#
# It keeps the tree clean; it does not hold the rule, though it was believed to. THIS script
# installs it, at session start, so a clone before that point has no filter at all — which is
# how the store path once reached master. `required` below closes the neighbouring case, a
# filter that runs and fails. `tests/Yession.Tests/LockSource.fs` refuses the content instead,
# on every pull request, and cannot be missing from anybody's clone; read it before changing
# anything here.
#
# `.git` is a DIRECTORY only in an ordinary clone. In a WORKTREE — which is what a Claude Code
# session gets when it runs work in parallel — it is a file naming the real one, so
# `$repo/.git/info` is a path that cannot be created and `mkdir -p` fails: under `set -e`, and
# after devenv.local.yaml has already been written, which is how a session in a worktree got a
# half-configured checkout and no filter at all. Two agents hit it independently.
#
# Ask git instead, and ask for the COMMON directory rather than this worktree's own. Git reads
# `info/attributes` from the common one for every worktree (verified: a per-worktree copy is
# not consulted even when it exists), which is also where `git config` puts the filter that
# attribute names — so both halves land in the one place, installed once for every worktree
# cut from this clone.

# A clean filter that FAILS is IGNORED by default: git prints `error: external filter ...

# a different route, and the route is real: this runs before Nix exists, so the filter's
# `python3` is whatever the image has. `required` makes the failure fatal instead, so the
# guard fails closed rather than open.
#
# It governs BOTH directions, and an UNDEFINED smudge counts as a failure — so the identity
# one has to be spelled out. Without it, `required` turns every checkout of this file into

# left in the working tree to be reviewed rather than silently added.
#
# `devenv info` first, because the settle has to happen to a lock that ALREADY carries the
# node: settling a pristine one achieves nothing and the session's first real devenv command
# dirties it all over again. It costs ~0.1s, it is the cheapest devenv verb that resolves
# inputs (`version` does not), and once the node is there devenv leaves the file alone — so
# this runs once per container and every later command finds the tree clean.
#
# The one thing it does not cover: a `git checkout` that rewrites devenv.lock puts back the
# node-less blob, and the next devenv command re-adds the node, so the file reports modified
# again until the next session start settles it. That is cosmetic. In this clone the filter
# still keeps the node out of the index; in every clone `LockSource` keeps it out of master.
