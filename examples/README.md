# Examples

Integrations, built the way somebody outside this repository would build them.

Everything here is **standalone**. An example references nothing from `Yession.Domain` or
`Yession.Host`, has its own project and its own bundle, and is not carried by the npm package
or the Nix installable. That separation is the whole point: an example that quietly reaches
into the product's internals demonstrates a path only this repository can walk.

Build one from the repository root, whichever ecosystem it belongs to:

```bash
dotnet fsi tasks.fsx example serial        # Fable + esbuild
dotnet fsi tasks.fsx example jumpstarter   # uv, and its own pytest suite
dotnet fsi tasks.fsx example proxy         # plain Node; nothing to build, so it only parses it
dotnet fsi tasks.fsx example nix-store     # shell scripts; nothing to build, so it only parses them
```

|---|---|
| [serial](serial/) | An MCP server that lends the host's serial devices to an agent. Shows the shape of a provider that owns a **resource**: arbitration, a session-scoped claim, and a second transport for the bytes a tool call cannot carry. |
| [jumpstarter](jumpstarter/) | An MCP server that lends a [Jumpstarter](https://jumpstarter.dev) exporter to an agent. Shows a provider that owns a **service**, written in the language that service's SDK is written in — Python here, and none the worse for it. |
| [proxy](proxy/) | The other direction: not something a session talks to, but what a deployment's **reverse proxy** is fed by. Renders the registry stream into the proxy's own config through a template, and shows one Caddy composition — behind `tailscale serve`, translating its identity headers — end to end. |
| [nix-store](nix-store/) | Not an integration at all but an operator's half of one: the `pin` a session runs inside each sandbox holding a shared Nix store, and the `sweep` that collects the store without taking any sandbox's shell with it. |

## Why a provider rather than a feature

Yession declares MCP servers by url, and a session's own MCP client does the rest. Nothing in
the product knows what serial is — which means a provider is not a plugin with a blessed
interface to conform to. It is a server. If your integration can answer `initialize`,
`tools/list` and `tools/call` over HTTP, it is already declarable.

The interesting design questions are therefore not about Yession at all. They are the ones the
serial example works through: who owns a resource the OS hands out exactly once, what happens
to that claim when the client crashes, and how you carry a stream when your protocol is
request/response.
