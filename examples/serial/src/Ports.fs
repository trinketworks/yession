module SerialProvider.Ports

// The engine behind the serial provider (Plan 16, part E): enumerate the host's ports, and
// open one as a byte stream.
//
// A SEAM rather than a direct dependency, for the reason every other backend in this repo is
// one. `serialport` is a native addon, and the provider must be testable — and shippable —
// where it is absent:
//
//   * it is a LAZY dynamic import, so a process that never opens a port never loads the
//     addon, and a box without it degrades to "no devices" rather than failing to start.
//     That is Plan 16's own wording and it is what makes the provider safe to run anywhere.
//   * the tests drive the provider through a fake engine, so the MCP lifecycle and the
//     WebSocket attach are covered on a box with no hardware at all — which is every CI box
//     we have.
//
// Cross-platform without a branch here: `serialport` is the portability layer (Linux, macOS,
// Windows), and `@serialport/bindings-cpp` ships prebuilt addons for each in its own tarball,
// so an ordinary `npm install` of the published package gets a working engine everywhere.

/// The interval is not belt-and-braces over the `close`/`error` handlers — it covers a case
/// they demonstrably do not. An IDLE open port whose device has gone away emits NEITHER
/// event: measured against a hung-up tty, `serialport` sat there with `isOpen === true`
/// indefinitely, and only surfaced EIO when something tried to write. Nothing writes to a
/// device the human is only reading from, so without this an unplugged adapter is
/// indistinguishable from a quiet one and the attached terminal waits forever. What the
/// handlers cover and this does not is the reverse: OUR close, and an I/O error on a device
/// node that still exists.
///
/// Vanishing is detected by the device node disappearing, because that is what unplugging
/// actually does — `/dev/ttyUSB0` is removed, exactly as a pty slave is removed when its
/// master hangs up. Armed only when the path exists as a file at open time, which keeps it
/// off Windows, where `COM3` is not a filesystem entry and the check would report every
