module SerialProvider.Mcp

// Serving MCP over Streamable HTTP.
//
// Deliberately small, and deliberately hand-written. One POST endpoint, JSON responses, a
// session id, and the three methods a tool server needs. No GET stream (this server pushes
// nothing), no resources, no prompts, no pagination — every one of those is machinery with no
// producer here, and MCP lets a server decline what it does not implement by simply not
// declaring the capability.
//
// If you are writing your own provider, this file is the part you could replace with an SDK.
// It is written out longhand because the whole claim of the example is that a provider is an
// ordinary HTTP server: ~150 lines, no framework, and the protocol is legible on the page.
