/// Finding an `[<Emit>]` macro, for the rules that have something to say about one.
///
/// Two of them do, and they ask different questions of the same string: whether its `$N`
/// correspond to the arguments the binding takes (`EmitMacro`), and whether the JavaScript
/// around them survives being pasted into a caller's scope (`EmitBody`). What they share is
/// how the string is found at all, and that belongs in one place — a rule that reads emits
/// slightly differently from its sibling is a rule with its own blind spot.

/// Fable's placeholder syntax: `$N`, plus `$N...` to spread the rest from N onwards. Both
/// name a slot, which is all either rule asks about — the spread's trailing dots, and the
/// `{{ }}` conditional blocks Fable also understands, change what is EMITTED, never which
/// arguments exist to be emitted.
///
/// A `$` not followed by a digit is not a placeholder, and `app/Ssr.fs` is full of them:
/// `/="?$/` is a regex end anchor, and `_$litType$` is the property name Lit marks its own
/// values with.

/// readings a rule wants is its own business: one asks WHICH slots are named, the other how

/// EmitIndexer, EmitProperty — take a NAME and let Fable write the call around it, so there
/// is no macro in one to be wrong.
///
/// The attribute's range is also the identity of the binding for these rules. Asking the
/// symbol for its own location is not: FCS refuses `DeclarationLocation` outright for some of
/// them, and a module-level `let` reaches a walk twice anyway.
