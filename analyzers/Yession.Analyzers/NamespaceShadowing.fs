/// `open Yession.Domain` brings every SUB-NAMESPACE of it into scope by short name. So the
/// moment the domain is split into feature namespaces, `Yession.Domain.Terminals` puts the name
/// `Terminals` in front of every file that opens the domain — including files that already
/// meant something else by it.
///
/// What happens then is the record-shape fault again, on a different axis. Given a file whose
/// enclosing scope offers a module `Terminals`, and an `open` that offers a namespace
/// `Terminals`, a reference to `Terminals.foo` resolves to the NAMESPACE when the namespace has
/// a `foo`, and falls through to the module when it does not. Neither outcome is reported.
/// Verified against the compiler rather than assumed: with a member of the same name on both
/// sides, the opened namespace wins silently; with no shared member, the module resolves and
/// the build is clean.
///
/// So the fall-through is what makes the natural names usable — `Yession.Domain.Terminals`
/// alongside `Yession.Host.Terminals` is fine while nothing is named twice — and it is also
/// what makes the hazard invisible. Nothing goes wrong until somebody adds a member to the
/// domain side that the module already has, in a file that has never heard of either. That is
/// the same shape as the `{ Scope; Name }` capture: a declaration reaching back to re-point
/// call sites its author never opened.
///
/// The rule is therefore about MEMBERS, not names. Two things may share a short name; they may
/// not also share a member. Sharing the name alone is not the fault, which matters because the
/// codebase already does it four times over (`Yession.Domain` beside the suite's
/// `Yession.Tests.Domain`, `Yession.Session` beside its `Yession.Tests.Session`) and those are
/// correct — they are simply disjoint, and this pins them there.
///
/// A namespace's members are its types and its nested namespaces and modules: a namespace
/// cannot hold a `let`, so nothing else is reachable as `Short.member`. A module's are those
/// plus its values.
///
/// It is deliberately blind to whether the two are ever in scope together. That is not a
/// property of either declaration — it belongs to some third file's `open` list, which changes
/// without either author present. What it is not blind to is whether they COULD be: only
/// publicly reachable scopes take part, because the hazard is what an `open` of a shared parent
/// puts in front of an arbitrary file, and a scope nothing outside can name is not something an
/// arbitrary file can open.
///
/// This was a test suite that read F# source with regular expressions — one pattern for the
/// declaration that opens a scope, one for a type or module inside it, one for a value binding
/// — over a hand-kept list of directories. Its fixtures were assembled out of escaped string
/// literals, because a scope written down the page would have been a real scope in a real
/// scanned file, and it needed two anti-vacuity cases (more than 100 scopes found, at least
/// eight domain namespaces) because a reader that has stopped seeing declarations and a
/// repository that obeys the rule are the same green run. What the text could not recover at
/// all is a member this assembly did not declare: the population was files, so a namespace
/// extended by a referenced assembly was short by exactly that member. `Population.fs` reads
/// the assembly graph, so a namespace is what the compiler says it is.
