/// What a rule about USE reads: every call this project's own code makes, and the binding each
/// one is written inside.
///
/// `Population` is the other half of the same idea and answers a different question — what a
/// project could NAME, which is what the scoping rules ask. A rule about what the code DOES
/// needs the expressions, and those come only from the project's own implementation files: a
/// referenced assembly hands over its declarations, never its bodies. That is not a limitation
/// to work around, it is the shape of the question. A use is somewhere, and the somewhere is
/// always here.
///
/// Read once per project and kept, for the same reason the population is: the walk is over
/// every expression in every file, and the answer is the same for each of them. Kept for as
/// long as that project is the one being analyzed, and no longer — see `Kept`.
