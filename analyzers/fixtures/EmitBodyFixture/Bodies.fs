/// One macro of every shape the rule has an opinion about. A line marked `// YES003` MUST be
/// reported; every other macro here MUST NOT be. `lint` reads those markers and compares them
/// to what the analyzer actually said, in both directions — a rule that has started rejecting
/// safe bodies is as broken as one that has gone blind.
///
/// The marker sits on the ATTRIBUTE rather than the binding because that is where the rule
/// reports: the string is the half that is wrong.
///
/// The violations below are written out. That is the point of moving this off a scan of F#
/// source: the suite this replaced could not quote one, because a violating macro written
/// literally in a scanned file would have been a real violation of the contract it was
/// checking, so its fixtures were assembled from concatenated fragments and only ever tested
/// the detector against strings, never against a real binding.

// Prose warning about this rule necessarily contains examples of breaking it, and one of the
// macros in `examples/serial/src/Ws.fs` carries exactly that. Reading a comment as code would
// make the warning itself the violation.
