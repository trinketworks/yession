/// One scope of every shape the rule has an opinion about. A line marked `// YES005` MUST be
/// reported; every other declaration here MUST NOT be. `lint` reads those markers and compares
/// them to what the analyzer actually said, in both directions — a rule that has started
/// rejecting disjoint scopes is as broken as one that has gone blind.
///
/// The marker sits on the shared MEMBER rather than on either scope, because that is where the
/// rule reports: a namespace has no single declaration to point at, and the member is the thing
/// that has to be renamed.
///
/// The violations are written out as real scopes. That is most of the point of moving this off
/// a scan of F# source: the suite this replaced read every `.fs` file under `app`, `src`,
/// `tests` and `examples`, so a scope written down the page here would have been a real scope
/// in a real scanned file. Its fixtures were therefore assembled from escaped string literals
/// and only ever tested the reader against text.

// --- reported: a namespace and a module, one short name, one shared member -------------------

// `Widgets`, and `Widgets.Gadget` silently resolves to the namespace.

// suite's `Yession.Tests.Domain`, `Yession.Session` beside its `Yession.Tests.Session`. The
// reference falls through to the module and the build is clean; sharing the name alone is not
// the fault, and a rule that said otherwise would be unusable.

// --- not reported: two namespaces --------------------------------------------------------

// sealed where no other file can name it is not something an arbitrary file can open, so it
// shadows nothing.
