  # The build's source: the TRACKED tree, minus the tracked files the build does not consume.
  # Two filters, both load-bearing.
  #
  # 1. `.gitignore`, compiled to a filter from the repo's own file (`nix-gitignore`, pure — it
  #    reads the patterns, it never shells out to git). What git ignores is by construction not
  #    source, and this is the ONLY filter that makes a build off a working tree equal a build
  #    off a fresh checkout. Without it a local build carried ~176MB of the dev shell's output —
  #    dotnet `obj/`/`bin/`, Fable's `.js` emitted beside the F# sources, `app/out`, `dist/`,
  #    `.devenv` — which invalidated the (slow) F#/Fable build on every local `check` and let
  #    stale emitted JS into a derivation that then regenerates it. Worst of it: `node_modules`
  #    is a SYMLINK to ${nodeModules}/node_modules in a dev shell (devenv's enterShell), and that
  #    store path is also a build input of `staged` — so the copy landed a live symlink to a
  #    read-only directory exactly where `staged` copies, and the build died on
  #      cp: cannot create directory './node_modules/node_modules'
  #    No CI job can see any of this: every one of them builds a flake source copy, which git
  #    already filtered. It reproduces only where a working tree reaches the derivation —
  #    `nix build --file nix/worktree.nix …`, `devenv build outputs.…`, `nix build path:.#…`.
  #    `check Nix` is the gate that now covers exactly that route (tasks.fsx).
  #

  #    invalidate the build. README.md is kept — tasks.fsx copies it into the package.
