# node-pty's native addon, built from source under Nix (Plan 13, stage 2c).
#
# A pipe is not a tty: no line discipline, no SIGWINCH, and most full-screen programs refuse
# or degrade. `node-pty` is what gives the host backend a real pty, and it is a native addon,
# so it lands here the way `node-datachannel` does — built from source and overlaid into the
# `nodeModules` derivation — rather than through an npm install that would fetch a prebuilt.
#
# It has to be built rather than downloaded for a plainer reason than node-datachannel's:
# node-pty 1.1.0 ships prebuilds for darwin and win32 only. There is no Linux `.node` in the
# tarball at all, so on the platform CI actually runs, `npm install` would compile it anyway
# — and its `install` script (`node scripts/prebuild.js || node-gyp rebuild`) reaches the
# network to decide which. Both are things a sandboxed build cannot do.
#
# Simpler than node-datachannel in one respect: node-pty vendors no third-party C++ library,
# so there is no FetchContent to patch out. It needs exactly one thing on top of its own
# sources — node-addon-api's headers — and the Node headers to compile against.
