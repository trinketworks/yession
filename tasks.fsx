// The complete, standalone build interface for Yession. Every Yession-specific build/test/
// package function lives here so that devenv (devenv.nix scripts) and CI (.github/workflows)
// are thin wrappers — you can throw both away and still drive everything directly with
// `dotnet fsi tasks.fsx <verb>`. Only tool-specific glue (nix/devenv bootstrap, actions/*
// steps, artifact upload) stays in the callers; no Yession logic does.
//
// The verbs are the dispatch at the bottom of this file; each has its own section below. A
// bare version (`dotnet fsi tasks.fsx 1.2.3`) is shorthand for `package`.
//
// Yession ships as ONE npm package with two bins: `yession` (the Manager) and
// `yession-session` (a Session Process). Each is esbuild-bundled to a single ESM file
// with the native / self-resolving deps kept EXTERNAL — node-datachannel loads its addon and
// the Agent SDK resolves its native `claude` sibling via import.meta.url, neither of which
// works bundled. Assets are copied in and read package-relative at runtime.

//
//     +semver: major | breaking   (or a BREAKING CHANGE: footer)  -> 2.0.0-beta.0
//     +semver: minor | feature                                    -> 1.1.0-beta.0

//
// A marker counts anywhere in the message as long as it is alone on its line; BREAKING CHANGE:
// is read only from the footer. Markers are scanned over the commits since the last reachable v*
// tag. A tag is cut on every green push, so that range is normally the single merge commit. A
// plain `feat:` deliberately does NOT bump minor: with a tag per push, nearly every release would
// bump. Breaking changes are the case worth catching automatically, so BREAKING CHANGE: is
// honoured alongside the explicit marker.

// a tier that spawns real processes it is a pool every suite draws on, so a case that

// Ports/Native/Srt on this box) for the same reason `waitForTimeoutMs` is 30s against sub-9s
// waits — this is a hang detector, and the sharp instruments are elsewhere.
