module Yession.Tests.Jumpstarter

// The jumpstarter provider (Plan 18), end to end — and the one thing its own pytest suite
// structurally cannot prove.
//
// That suite drives the provider with a client written beside it, in the same language, out
// of the same head. This one drives it with OUR client: `McpClient`, the code a session
// actually uses, over real HTTP against a real provider process talking to a real exporter.
// Two implementations that were never checked against each other agreeing is the only
// evidence that either read the protocol right — the same argument the serial suite makes,
// and worth making twice because this provider is somebody else's SDK behind our contract.
//
// `Jumpstarter`, because it needs uv, a resolvable Python environment, and two processes:
// see `jumpstarterAvailable` in tasks.fsx, which probes it by RUNNING it.
