module Yession.Tests.ToolStreams

// A stream a provider offers becomes a terminal (Plan 19).
//
// The contract is the whole feature, so it is what is pinned here — not the plumbing that
// carries it. Four things have to hold no matter which provider is on the other end:
//
//   * the smallest conforming offer is a url, and everything absent reads conservatively —
//     a provider that says nothing about its capabilities gets the least a source can be,
//     never the most;
//   * a session dials only what the server it was DECLARED at can vouch for, and says so in
//     the answer when it will not;
//   * one stream is one terminal, however many times a provider mentions it — a `status`
//     tool polled every turn must not fill the pane;
//   * a tool that offers nothing is untouched, because the decorator sits on the path EVERY
//     call takes.
