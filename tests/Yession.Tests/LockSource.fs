module Yession.Tests.LockSource

// What the COMMITTED devenv.lock is allowed to say.
//
// One rule: it carries the `nixpkgs` node and nothing else. `devenv.yaml` names nixpkgs by a
// CHANNEL, which moves, so the lock is what makes two jobs in one pull request build against
// the same thing; devenv's own input is deliberately absent, because in a github-restricted
// sandbox `devenv.local.yaml` replaces it with a /nix/store path from THAT container, which is
// not a fact about this repository and is not valid anywhere else. `.gitignore` states both
// halves at length.
//
// It was already guarded, by a clean filter `.claude/setup.sh` installs into `.git/info`, and
// the guard was believed total — "the store path cannot reach the index even by `git commit
// -a`". That is true of a clone where the filter is INSTALLED. It says nothing about a clone
// where it is not yet, and the filter arrives only when setup runs, which is at session start.
// A container whose session began before the filter existed spent two commits in that window
// and put `/nix/store/lxdvfnj1yvx2jg9wn9680792dvhwbx0v-source` on master, silently, through a
// guard that had just been hardened against the OTHER way it fails (a filter that runs and
// errors — #254). Absent is a third state, and it is fail-open.
//
// So the check moved to where no clone's local configuration can be missing it. A filter keeps
// a working tree clean, which is worth having and is why it stays; this refuses the content.
// `YES007`, the rule that keeps the environment written from one place, says the same thing
// about a different guard: it fires on the pull request that writes it.
//
// No capability: it reads a file.
