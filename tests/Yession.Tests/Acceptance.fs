module Yession.Tests.Acceptance

// Step 09 — the Phase 1 acceptance gate's own checks. The seven required E2E scenarios
// and the model/protocol invariants live in their step suites (Sync/Agent/E2E/Client/
// Domain/SessionProcess — every E2E-N is named in its test title); this file pins the
// remaining acceptance items: the UI checklist, rendered from one representative model,
// and the random peer display name.
//
// The `(E2E-N)` suffixes are the phase acceptance gates' scenario numbers, and they are
// numbered PER PHASE — Phase 1's E2E-1 is the two-client draft, Phase 2's is the
// conversational one-shot. The gate documents that held both lists are gone; the titles are
// the index now, so a scenario's number means nothing without the phase beside it.
