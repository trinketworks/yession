module Yession.Tests.Agent

// Step 08 verification: the agent turn as events.
//
// Repeatable by construction: the deterministic tests inject scripted `RunAgent`
// runners — the full lifecycle (streamed deltas -> completed | failed) is exercised
// through the orchestrator, the projection, and the real WebRTC stack (E2E-5) without
// any dependence on live model output. The real Claude Agent SDK adapter is verified by
// a smoke test carrying the `LiveAgent` capability — it runs in any tier that asks for
// one, and stands in a visible skip in the tiers that do not.
