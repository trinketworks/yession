module Yession.Tests.Phase2

// Phase 2 verification, step by step:
//
// - Step 10: the Session Manager owns launch — launching registers a Session Process
//   and returns a reachable bootstrap URI; Phase 1 behaviour is preserved under a
//   Manager-launched Process.
//
// Later steps extend this module (scoped capabilities, lazy environments, commands).

// commands are terminal blocks now and a block's bytes belong in its transcript rather than
// in the event log a second time. Its fold and its streaming test went with it, covered where
// the behaviour moved (`Terminals`, `PtyIntegration`).
//
// The COMMAND TIMEOUT went too, and deliberately rather than by omission: a block is owned by
// the session, not by the turn that asked for it, so a deadline is now a YIELD — the tool
// returns `Running` with a handle and the command runs on — where the old one killed the
// process. `TerminalCommandWait` is where that is pinned.

// What must not be lost is the SECURITY property, which is about the sandbox seam rather than
// about any tool on top of it.

// how it hands the environment back is load-bearing for everything compiled after it. It
// once handed it back by DELETING the name, which silently disarmed the whole LiveAgent
// tier: those sessions started with no credential, `SessionMain` answers that by starting no
// agent at all, and a turn just never got a reply. `Support.withEnv` is the fix; these three
