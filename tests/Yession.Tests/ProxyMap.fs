module Yession.Tests.ProxyMap

// The proxy example (`examples/proxy`), driven end to end: a real Manager under
// `--auth trusted-headers`, a real session process, and the map process following the
// registry stream into a file the way a deployment's reverse proxy reads it.
//
// The example is standalone by rule — it reads the stream and the two documented
// placeholders, nothing of this repository's code — so this is the only place the two halves
// of that contract are checked against each other: what the Manager publishes, and what the
// map makes of it. Its own README can say what it does; only a run can say it still does.
//
// `Ports` and `Native`: a session's port is what gets rendered, and only a real session
// process has one.
