module Yession.Tests.Resilience

// The client's two network legs when they fail — the durable history feed (HTTP) and the
// session transport (the data channel) — at the seams where they actually fail.
//
// Integration, not E2E, and deliberately so: the socket is a FUNCTION here, so "the network
// is down" is a value the test chooses rather than a server it has to kill and a race it has
// to win. Everything on either side of that function is production code — the real
// `EventFetch.overHttp` (URL scheme, chunk math, JSONL codec), the real resilience policy
// that ships in the browser, the real `Client.connect` read loop, the real `ClientModel`, and
// the real Session Process host on the other end of an in-memory channel. That combination —
// durable history over HTTP, collaborative state over the data channel — is precisely the one
// the browser runs, and the one no existing suite covered.
//
// What these pin:
//   * a failed read is REPORTED, not silently turned into an empty final page (which is what
//     made the original bug invisible: the loop read "nothing new yet" and re-requested
//     forever, while drafts, title, and presence kept syncing over the data channel);
//   * retries happen only where retrying can help, on a bounded schedule, in zero real time
//     (the clock is injected, so backoff is asserted rather than slept through);
//   * the client stays fully usable while history is stalled — writing, sending, and
//     collaborating are local-first CRDT operations that never touch the feed;
//   * the feed recovers on its own, resuming from where consumption stopped;
//   * and the session lifecycle keeps the promise the model makes — a dropped session comes
//     back and resumes, a refused one does not, and a transport that never opens settles with
//     a reason instead of leaving the shell on "connecting" forever.
