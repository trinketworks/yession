module Yession.Tests.Resources

// The resources algebra, under Hedgehog.
//
// Flattening a selection is where the interesting mistakes live — a cycle, a diamond, two
// grants that cannot both hold, a dangerous grant hidden inside a friendly name — and every
// one of them is decidable without touching a filesystem. So this suite needs no capability
// and runs on both runtimes, which is the point: what is believed about the algebra is
// believed here, not inferred from a later end-to-end run.
//
// The generators CONSTRUCT the shapes they need rather than filtering for them. The vendored
// Hedgehog has no `Gen.filter`, no shrinking and no `Gen.choice`, so "draw graphs until one
// is acyclic" is not available — and it would be the wrong instinct anyway, because a
// generator that rejects most of its draws tests the rejection more than the subject.
//
// One thing deliberately has no test: that a COMPOSITE cannot be declared sensitive. It has
// no representation in `ResourceDecl`, so a case asserting it could only prove that the test
// file compiles.
