module Yession.Tests.Connections

// Plan 08: the Manager's standards-only connection broker and the session-side Claude
// module over it. Pure flow logic, envelope + wire codecs, and Claude classification run
// in the cheap tier; the broker service and control routes run under [Ports] against a
// fake token endpoint (the broker must never need the real claude.ai to be provable).
