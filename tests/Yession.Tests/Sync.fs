module Yession.Tests.Sync

// Step 05 verification: the Ylmish sync boundary.
//
// - Model tests: decode∘encode preserves `SyncedSessionState`; the doc contains drafts
//   but never the conversation projection ("Ylmish is the sync boundary" — nothing else
//   crosses it).
// - Convergence: two full client programs over two docs converge on one draft, first
//   synced in-memory (deterministic, no IO), then over a real WebRTC data channel with
//   the Session Process relaying `State` frames (E2E-1). Drafts are keyed by author (one
//   per client); collaboration is co-editing a peer's slot.
//
// Event-driven throughout: models are observed via predicate waiters resolved on every
// Elmish `setState` — no sleeps or polling.
