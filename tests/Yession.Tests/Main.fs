/// The repo's one test suite, shared by both runtimes Pyxpecto runs on. Each suite declares
/// what it NEEDS (`Tag.needs`), and the harness runs it only where those needs are met — so
/// the SAME list serves both targets with no `#if` here:
///   * Fable → JS on Node (`check` / `verify`): the model/protocol/WebRTC suites — the
///     JavaScript the product actually runs.
///   * .NET CLR (`dotnet run --project tests/Yession.Tests`): the real-browser E2E, driven
///     through the Microsoft.Playwright driver.
/// A suite with no needs runs on Node (the product runtime). `[Browser]` pins the .NET CLR;
/// every other need is a capability the run declares via `YESSION_TEST_CAPS` (e.g.
/// `check Browser Native`). `Native` marks suites that spawn the real Session
/// Process (which loads the node-datachannel addon), so they skip — rather than error — where
/// that addon is absent. Whatever this run cannot host or satisfy shows as one visible skip.
