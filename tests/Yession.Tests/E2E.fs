module Yession.Tests.E2E

// End-to-end verification of the real WebRTC transport: starts a Session Process and a
// client peer in this Node process, connects them over an actual libdatachannel data
// channel, and checks the token-gated handshake plus presence events.
//
// Everything is event-driven — awaits ICE gathering completion, the data-channel `open`
// event, frame receipt, and an eagerly-registered "session ended" signal. No sleeps or
// polling, so results do not depend on timing.
