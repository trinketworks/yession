module Yession.Tests.TerminalPattern

// The pattern subset a terminal wait accepts (Plan 25, step 9).
//
// What is under test is not "does this behave like a regex" — it deliberately does not, in
// ways the refusals name. It is two promises: that the supported constructs mean what a
// caller expects, and that NO pattern can cost more than linear time. The second is the whole
// reason this exists instead of a `RegExp`, and it has a test that would hang rather than
// fail if it were untrue.
