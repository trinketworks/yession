module Yession.Tests.Attach

// Attaching a terminal to somebody else's byte stream (Plan 16, part D), over a real
// WebSocket against a loopback provider.
//
// The provider below is also the REFERENCE implementation `docs/streams.md` points an
// outside implementer at: the smallest thing that conforms, running on every `check Ports`.
// That is the only reason it cannot rot — a sample nobody executes drifts from the client
// it claims to match, which is what the spec exists to stop.
//
// The provider here is written by hand — an HTTP upgrade, the RFC 6455 accept hash, and
// enough frame handling to echo — rather than built on a library, and that is the point
// rather than an inconvenience: the whole reason for choosing WebSocket over something of
// our own is that a THIRD PARTY can implement the other end. A test that talked to our own
// client through our own server abstraction would prove only that the two agreed.
//
// `Ports`, because the upgrade is the thing being tested and there is no meaningful
// in-memory stand-in for it.

/// anything — which is the case an in-band termination frame exists FOR, since an abnormal
/// closure carries nothing.
/// Public rather than private to this module: `NodeExtras.fs` drives the WebSocket BINDING
/// against the same provider. A second hand-rolled RFC 6455 server in this suite would be a
/// second thing to keep in step with the spec the first one is the reference for.
