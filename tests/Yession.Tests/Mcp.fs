// Declaring MCP servers (Plan 17, step 1): the vocabulary, and the one question it answers.
//
// Pure — no socket, no Manager, no session. Everything here is a fact about a LIST, which is
// the whole reason resolution was made a function over declarations rather than a lookup on
// a session record: the interesting cases are COMBINATIONS of declarations, and they cost
// nothing to write down.
