module Yession.Tests.Assets

// The static asset service serves what the build DECLARES (`AssetFile`) — not what happens to
// be lying in a directory, and not whatever a request path asks for.
//
// The declaration is shared with `tasks.fsx`, which matches over it exhaustively to produce
// each file, so build-and-server agreement is a compile error rather than a test. What is left
// for a test is the serving contract: the right bytes, under this build's address only, wearing
// the content type the declaration gives them.
//
// Node only: `Assets` reads files and writes an HTTP response, which is the runtime the product
// runs on. No capability — writing a temp directory is what every store suite here already does.
