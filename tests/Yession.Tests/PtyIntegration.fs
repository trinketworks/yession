module Yession.Tests.PtyIntegration

// `SpawnPty` on the sandbox seam, driven for real (Plan 13, stage 2c).
//
// Everything here asserts the ONE thing a pipe can never do. A test that merely spawns a
// process and reads its output would pass over `Spawn` just as happily, and would therefore
// prove nothing about ptys at all — so the assertions are the properties a terminal device
// has and a pipe does not: `tty` names a device, `isatty` is true, a resize is visible to
// the program, and stdout and stderr arrive on one stream because a tty has one.
//
// The suite sits under `Tag.needs [Pty]`, and `check` probes the capability by OPENING a
// pty rather than by looking for the addon's file — a package that resolves is not a kernel
// that will hand out `/dev/pts`.
