module Yession.Tests.Client

// End-to-end verification of the Browser Client shell against a real Session Process: the
// client connects over an actual WebRTC data channel, completes the token-gated
// handshake, and its Elmish model reflects the connection-state transitions and the
// offset / catch-up indicators the product requires. A dropped channel moves the model to
// `Reconnecting`.
//
// Event-driven throughout: the model is observed via predicate "waiters" that resolve the
// moment a dispatched message satisfies them — no sleeps or polling.
