module Yession.Tests.WorkSandboxes

// The session's named WorkSandboxes (Plan 15, stage 2). What is worth pinning is the
// ENSURE contract and the credential-handling rules, because those are what the
// declarative form and the shared trust boundary respectively rest on:
//
//   * the same ask twice is the same sandbox, and records nothing — otherwise folding a
//     file into these commands at every boot accumulates instead of converging;
//   * a DIFFERENT ask is refused rather than silently recreated, because recreating kills
//     whatever is running inside;
//   * what a forwarded credential provisions reaches the sandbox's environment and NOTHING
//     else — the event carries the names and whose, and cannot carry a value — and it is
//     taken back when the sandbox stops.
