module Yession.Tests.EventsHttp

// The event log over HTTP, read by CURSOR (Plan 20): a client sends the offset it
// has folded through (`GET /events/after/{n}?token=…`) and the server redirects to the
// range it chose (`/events/{first}-{last}`), whose bytes never change because its bounds
// do not. Verified here: that a range keeps answering the same bytes after the log has
// grown past it (the tail is the case the old fixed-chunk scheme could not hold), that a
// range the log has not reached is a 404 rather than a short answer, that a current caller
// gets `204`, token gating on both halves, and a full client consuming the log over the
// HTTP fetcher instead of frames.
