module Yession.Tests.RepoConfig

// The `yession.yaml` bridge (Plan 27): a real file on disk, through a real YAML parser, into
// the domain's decoder.
//
// The DECODER's own behaviour is pinned in `Domain.fs` from JSON literals, on both runtimes.
// What is left for this suite is only what a file can do that a JSON literal cannot — YAML
// syntax the parser has to be configured correctly to refuse or to allow, and the difference
// between a repo with no file and a repo with a broken one.
