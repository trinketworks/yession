module Yession.Tests.TranscriptHttp

// A terminal's transcript over HTTP, read by CURSOR (Plan 22): a client sends the line
// it has folded through (`GET /terminals/{t}/after/{n}?token=…`) and the server redirects to
// the range it chose (`/terminals/{t}/{first}-{last}`), whose bytes never change because line
// index IS sequence number and those bounds do not move.
//
// The event feed's tests are next door in `EventsHttp.fs` and this is deliberately their
// shape: same cursor, same redirect, same refusals. What is different, and is what these
// pin, is that a transcript is a TERMINAL's and its lines do not carry their own index.
