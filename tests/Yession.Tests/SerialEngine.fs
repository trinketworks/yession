module Yession.Tests.SerialEngine

// The serial engine itself (Plan 16, part E), against a real tty.
//
// Everything ABOVE the `SerialEngine` seam is already covered over real sockets, with the
// engine substituted — the MCP lifecycle, the claim, the WebSocket attach. This is the half
// that substitution deliberately skipped: `Ports.real`, which is the `serialport`
// import, the port open, the line settings, and the close.
//
// socat is what makes that testable with no hardware. `socat pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0`
// gives two pseudo-terminals wired to each other: open one with the real engine and the other
// with plain file I/O, and every byte that crosses went through a kernel tty — the same
// `open`, `termios` and `read` a USB adapter would use. What it cannot prove is anything about
// a specific chip; what it does prove is that we drive a serial port correctly, which is where
// the bugs were going to be.
//
// `Serial`, because the engine needs three things this repo cannot assume: the `serialport`
// addon, `udevadm` (Linux enumeration shells out to it), and socat.
