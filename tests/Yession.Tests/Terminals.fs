module Yession.Tests.Terminals

// Terminals on the WorkSandbox (Plan 12). Everything here runs in the CHEAP tier:
// the sandbox is a scripted `SessionEnvironment` record, so a block's whole lifecycle —
// spawn, streamed output, exit code, transcript, events — is exercised deterministically
// with no process, port, or native addon in the loop. What a real sandbox adds is covered
// where sandboxes already are (`Ports`/`Docker`), and is not what these tests are about.
