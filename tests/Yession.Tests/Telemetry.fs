module Yession.Tests.Telemetry

// Cheap-tier telemetry suites (no ports beyond localhost, no credentials, no native addons):
//   - the Fable.OpenTelemetry bindings resolve against the real SDK and round-trip a record;
//   - the app/Telemetry.fs emitter maps an AgentUsage onto a log record with the right
//     attributes, never throws, and selects its exporters from the standard OTEL_* env;
//   - a real OTLP payload reaches a stub collector intact — with no message content.
// Every process is a direct emitter now (no Manager-side collector); the stub stands in for a
// real OpenTelemetry Collector.
