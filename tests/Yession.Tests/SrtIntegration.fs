module Yession.Tests.SrtIntegration

// The srt backend, driven for real (PR 3 of the sandboxing plan). Everything
// here asserts DENIAL: a sandbox that runs commands is easy to build and proves nothing —
// what has to hold is that a command cannot read outside its policy, cannot write outside
// it, and cannot reach a domain the policy never named. The suite sits under
// `Tag.needs [Srt]`, and `check` probes for a WORKING bubblewrap (installed is not the
// same as permitted — user namespaces can be off) before declaring the capability, so a
// box without one reports a skip instead of a wall of failures.
//
// The one non-denial test is latency: srt was chosen over a container per command because
// it starts in milliseconds, and a regression there is a regression in the reason.
