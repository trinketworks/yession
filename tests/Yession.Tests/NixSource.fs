module Yession.Tests.NixSource

// What the Nix derivations are allowed to see of this repository (`src` in nix/packages.nix).
//
// This is the one contract in the build that NO CI job can check. Every route CI takes —
// `nix build .#yession`, the darwin package job, release.yml's package-nix — evaluates a FLAKE,
// and a flake's source copy has already been filtered by git: nothing ignored can reach the
// derivation, whatever the filter in packages.nix does or fails to do. Only a working tree
// reaches it unfiltered (`nix build --file nix/worktree.nix`, `devenv build outputs.…`), and
// only a machine that has entered the dev shell HAS the artefacts that leak. So the failure
// mode is exactly inverted from the usual one: green everywhere in CI, broken on the laptop.
//
// It broke that way once already. devenv's enterShell points `node_modules` at
// `${nodeModules}/node_modules` in the store, that same path is a build input of `staged`, and
// the unfiltered copy landed a live symlink to a read-only directory exactly where `staged`
// copies its own:
//
//     cp: cannot create directory './node_modules/node_modules'
//
// Alongside it, ~176MB of dotnet obj/bin, Fable's emitted .js and app/out rode in, so a local
// build was neither the build CI ran nor cacheable across a single edit.
//
// The invariant asserted here is the general one — the derivation source carries nothing git
// ignores — rather than a list of the artefacts that leaked. A new build output added to
// .gitignore next month is covered without touching this file.
//
// Needs the `Nix` capability: `check` probes for the nix CLI and drops it when absent, so this
// reports a skip rather than an error on a box without Nix.
