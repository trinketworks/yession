module Yession.Tests.Queries

// The query surface (Plan 15). What is worth pinning here is not "a registry stores
// things" — it is the handful of properties the WHOLE design leans on:
//
//   * a query's answer is held to the shape it declared, so one renderer can draw every
//     query that will ever be registered without a case for the one that lied;
//   * the stream's opening burst IS the snapshot, so a subscriber needs nothing else and
//     there is no second mechanism to keep in step;
//   * a command is the only thing that can change an answer, so a command is the only
//     thing that has to say so — nothing polls;
//   * the door is shut: reading session state needs a session identity.
