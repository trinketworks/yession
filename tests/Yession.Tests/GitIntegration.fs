module Yession.Tests.GitIntegration

// Plan 14: the repo manager, driven for real against LOCAL bare fixtures — deterministic,
// no network — under the srt confinement the production git sandbox uses. The pure pieces
// (the hardened invocation env, branch-name validation, output capping) run in the cheap
// tier; the [Srt] suite proves the interesting property, which is not "clone works" but
// that repo-controlled execution stays OFF: a hook and an fsmonitor planted in the
// checkout (exactly what the WorkSandbox could write) must not fire through the verbs.
//
// Those tiers substitute the two things a person's request actually carries: a model choosing
// the verb, and github.com over https. The [LiveAgent] suite at the bottom is that same path
// with neither substituted — a real model choosing `add_repo`, a real checkout landing — and
// it runs on the release gate and passes on the default `host` agent backend. Under
// `YESSION_SESSION_AGENT_BACKEND=srt` it stalls, for a reason that is the Bun CLI's and not
// this verb's (docs/GAPS.md); srt is not the default, so the gate stays green.
