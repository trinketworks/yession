module Yession.Tests.Browser

// The real-browser E2E, as a Pyxpecto suite (the F# replacement for scripts/browser-e2e.fsx).
// Pyxpecto is multi-runtime: this file compiles for BOTH targets, but the browser flow only
// exists on the .NET CLR, where the Microsoft.Playwright driver lives. Under Fable (JS on
// Node) there is no Playwright, so the flow is `#if`-compiled out and a single visible case
// records where it moved. Run it with:
//
//     dotnet run --project tests/Yession.Tests/Yession.Tests.fsproj
//
// It launches two Chromium peers against a real Session Process (app/out/Main.js), verifies
// Markdown typed into the rich composer renders as formatted rich text (input rules), that the
// SECOND peer's composer joins that draft rather than opening a rival, that it converges over
// native WebRTC with live carets, that the second peer can co-edit AND send it — whose durable
// body is Markdown — rendering as that same formatted rich text in both timelines; then proves
// client-side IndexedDB persistence by wiping the server and reloading
// (the draft can only return from the browser), and that the doc store is session-keyed.
// Event-driven throughout (WaitForFunctionAsync); Playwright's own per-action timeouts watch.

//
// The browser comes from `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` — nixpkgs' playwright-driver, pinned by
// the same lock as the toolchain (devenv.nix) — and its layout is Playwright's, which differs
// per platform and has changed name across builds:
//
//   x86_64-linux    chrome-linux64/chrome
//   aarch64-linux   chrome-linux/chrome
//   aarch64-darwin  chrome-mac-arm64/Google Chrome for Testing.app/Contents/MacOS/…
//
// So the executable is found by NAME, from a known set, under the `chromium-<revision>`
// directory. Nothing here may hardcode a revision: it moves with every Playwright bump, and a
// stale one would fail as "no Chromium" long after the browser arrived.
//
// There is deliberately no fallback to a system Chrome. The revision is pinned so the browser
// matches the client driving it; silently launching whatever `/usr/bin/google-chrome` happens
// to be would make the suite's meaning depend on the host, which is the opposite of what
// pinning is for. `CHROMIUM_PATH` remains as the explicit override for someone who means it.

        // this product does, and nothing here could see it. Measured on a real deployment
        // against a session holding 230 events and 1,469 terminal records: a cold open spent
        // 10,087 full re-renders and ~22 seconds with the main thread never yielding — on an
        // M-series laptop. A phone is several times slower again, which is where it was
        // reported from: inputs dead, and the top of the conversation never painting because
        // no frame ever completed.
        //
        // The cause is one render per replayed record. `Client.fs`'s transcript replay
        // dispatches a message per record, Elmish calls `setState` per message, and
        // `setState` re-renders the whole view and reads layout back twice. So the cost is
        // records × the whole page, and the number that says so is a COUNT of renders.
        //

        // how many extra renders each extra transcript record adds to a reopen — and not a
        // duration, because a millisecond budget on a shared runner is the flaky test this
        // repository warns about while a count is the same number on every box. Marginal
        // rather than total, because a cold open costs a fixed number of renders whatever the
        // transcript holds, and that constant is not what got anybody's phone stuck: the
        // slope is. Two transcripts, one session, and the difference between them is the
        // measurement.
        //
        // The budget is set well above what the code does today (see `perRecord`), so this is
        // a guard against getting worse rather than a description of good — the storm above is
        // still there. Tightening this constant is how the fix that removes it gets proved.
        //
