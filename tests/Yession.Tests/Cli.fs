// The command-line boundary. Pure — cheap tier, every environment — because `Cli.parse`
// takes its args as a value rather than reading `process.argv`, which is the whole reason
// the boundary is testable at all.
//
// What these pin is that a MISUSE IS REFUSED. The parsing itself is Node's (`node:util`
// parseArgs) and is not this repo's to test; what is this repo's is that a mistyped or
// malformed command line stops the process instead of running it with the option missing.
// The old hand-rolled `process.argv` scan could not tell "not given" from "given wrong", so
// `yession-manager --auht localhost` booted a deny-everything Manager and looked like a hang.
