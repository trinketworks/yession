module Yession.Tests.Tools

// The tool registry (Plan 16, part A). What is worth pinning is not "a list holds
// descriptors" — it is the four properties everything downstream leans on:
//
//   * the auto-approve list is COMPUTED from the descriptors, so the model's tool list and
//     what runs without a permission round-trip cannot drift apart;
//   * a namespace is what lets two providers both offer `list`, and the call still reaches
//     the right one;
//   * a genuine collision is REFUSED rather than resolved, because silently shadowing one
//     tool with another shows up only as the wrong thing happening;
//   * a tool that ran and failed is not the same as a call that never happened — the model
//     must be able to read the first and act on it.
//
// And one property that is about the NEXT part rather than this one: `set_secret`'s value
// declares its own secrecy, in the schema, where the redactor will look for it.
