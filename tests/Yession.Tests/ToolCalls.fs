module Yession.Tests.ToolCalls

// A tool call, driven the way a TURN drives one, with no model in the loop.
//
// Everything between the model and the work has been testable for a while, one layer at a
// time: `Tools.fs` drives the registry over stub capabilities, `CommandGates.fs` drives the
// gate over a stub dispatch, `GitIntegration.fs` drives the repo service over local bare
// fixtures. Each of those is green while the CHAIN is broken, because the joins between them
// — the wire name, the encoded argument list, the rendered summary, and above all the wait —
// are exactly what none of them contains.
//
// This is that chain: the wire name a model would emit, through the registry the SDK adapter
// builds (`Agent.registryFor`), through the per-turn bindings a turn is given
// (`Commands.bindFor`), through the real command gate, into the real dispatch table
// (`Commands.dispatch`), and back out as the TEXT the model would read. Only the leaf — the
// service that touches git — is substituted, because what it does is somebody else's suite.
//
// What it caught on the first run is the reason it exists: an `add_repo` whose clone
// outlived a deadline meant for people answered "WAITING FOR A HUMAN TO APPROVE IT. It has
// NOT happened." — while it was happening, and while nobody had been asked anything. Every
// layer was individually right. The join was not.
