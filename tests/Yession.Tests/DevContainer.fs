module Yession.Tests.DevContainer

// This repo's OWN declared work environment, end to end through the product's pieces:
// yession.yaml decoded by the real decoder, the request resolved against the container's
// view of its checkout, the policy assembled by `policyFor`, the container started by the
// real docker backend. Written down after the whole path was proved by hand in a live
// session (the container pivot's final laps), because every invariant here broke at least
// once on the way there and every break was invisible to the cheap tier:
//
//   * the workdir wore a HOST path while the checkout sat under the /repos bind, with an
//     empty workspace volume shadowing it (#405)
//   * `docker exec` died on a nix-built image's symlinked /etc while `docker run` worked,
//     so the container looked up and answered nothing (#400)
//   * git refused the bind-mounted checkout as another user's (#404)
//   * nix could not initialise its store under the hardened capability profile (#401)
//   * a granted named volume read as held and was never mounted (#411)
//
// Two tiers. `Docker` alone buys the fast probes — a pulled image and a few execs, inside
// the release gate. The SELF-HOSTING case (`nix develop --command check` inside the
// container: this suite running itself) is `Docker Dogfood`, in no scheduled tier — run it
// when the container environment story changes:
//
//   check Docker Dogfood
//   gh workflow run verify.yml --ref <branch> -f capabilities="Docker Dogfood"
//
// Fixtures live under $HOME, not the system temp dir, on purpose: a bind mount's source
// must be visible to the DAEMON, and the common macOS arrangement (Colima) shares only
// $HOME into its VM — a fixture under /var/folders binds as an empty directory and every
// case fails saying the checkout is missing, which is the machine's fault, not the code's.
