module Yession.Tests.Phase4

// Phase 4 verification, step by step.
//
// - Step 22: Manager state behind an explicit codec — the registry survives a Manager
//   restart via an atomically-written JSON file; unknown fields decode tolerantly
//   (the SQLite-migration posture); corruption fails loudly, never a silent reset.
