// Cheap-tier end-to-end coverage that drives the REAL Session Process host over an
// in-memory channel pair (`host.Connect` + `Client.connect`) instead of a WebRTC data channel.
// Same production code path — the peer handshake, the doc State relay, the queue drain, the
// cursor-presence relay, and the title→Manager report — but with no WebRTC, no HTTP, and no
// native addon, so it runs on every PR. Event-driven throughout via model waiters; the one
// host-side signal (the Manager report) is awaited through a one-shot continuation.
//
// These close the coverage gap left by the collaborative-title feature: the presence relay
// and the title report were previously reachable only through the verify tier.
