module Yession.Tests.Version

// app/Version.fs and the version half of the spawn contract. Cheap tier: pure functions over
// strings, no ports, no processes.
//
// The load-bearing property here is what these functions must NOT do. `majorOf` gates the
// spawn-time skew REFUSAL (Plan 11), so reading a major out of a build that has no release
// version would refuse every dev run; and the readiness line's `version` field is an
// addition to an existing contract, so a session bundle built before it existed has to keep
// launching.
