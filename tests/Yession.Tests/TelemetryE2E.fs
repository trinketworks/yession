module Yession.Tests.TelemetryE2E

// The first telemetry e2e. Cheap tier: a real Session Process Host with the real telemetry
// emit sink, exporting over real localhost HTTP to a stub OTLP collector (the stand-in for a
// real OpenTelemetry Collector). A human message (injected the Phase-3 way — an offline peer's
// enqueue delivered into the Host's doc) drains into a turn; the scripted agent completes with
// usage; the sink ships it; the collector records it. No WebRTC, no native addon.
//
// This is the regression guard for the silent-no-op class: any break in the wire (sink not
// threaded, exporter miswired, decode mismatch) shows up here as zero — or wrong — records at
// the collector.
