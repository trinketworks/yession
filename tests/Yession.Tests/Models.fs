module Yession.Tests.Models

// The model catalogue, end to end below the browser: the provider lookup that produces it,
// and the status reply that carries it.
//
// What is worth pinning here is not "a list comes back". It is the handful of properties
// the picker leans on:
//
//   * a paged catalogue arrives WHOLE, because a lookup that silently stopped at page one
//     would read as "this provider offers nothing else";
//   * the credential decides the dialect, so an OAuth grant and an API key each present
//     themselves the way their provider expects rather than one guessing for both;
//   * a failed lookup says why, and says it all the way to the browser — "nobody has
//     connected an account" and "this provider offers nothing" are different facts and a
//     picker that conflated them would show an empty menu with no way out;
//   * it rides the credential status it is a fact about, so the two cannot disagree;
//   * the door is shut: what this session can run on is for the people in the session.
//
// Ports, because the lookup IS an HTTP conversation. There is no in-memory stand-in for
// paging, headers and a status code, and those are exactly what the cases turn on.
