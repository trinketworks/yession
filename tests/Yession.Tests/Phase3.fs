module Yession.Tests.Phase3

// Phase 3 (Steps 15–16) verification: the collaborative message queue and the drain.
//
// The named turn-scheduling races — delete-vs-accept and
// reorder-vs-accept in both orderings, edit-vs-accept, the crash-window repair, and
// drain liveness/single-flight — are pinned deterministically: peers are real client
// programs on their own Yjs docs, "delivery" is an explicit update application (so a
// peer can stay arbitrarily stale), and the agent is a hold-until-released runner, so
// every interleaving is scripted, not raced.
