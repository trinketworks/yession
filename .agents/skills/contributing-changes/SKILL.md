description: How a change gets from asked-for to merged and green — split the request into independently-shippable PRs, compare what you built to what was asked, open a PR with auto-merge, watch CI, and drive it to a merged, green master. Read this at the START of any request to build, fix, refactor or alter something, before the first edit, because it decides how the work is split and that decision cannot be taken later. Read it again when an implementation is done and before opening a PR, and after any CI failure on a PR you opened, since fixing and re-integrating repeats this process.

# Contributing changes

This is how work reaches master. It starts before the first edit, because the split into
PRs is decided there, and it does not end at "changes pushed" — a change isn't contributed
until it's merged and the master pipeline is green. This skill defines how a request is cut
up, the gate for proceeding autonomously, and the loop that drives each piece through.

No plan document is written for any of this. Think it through, say the shape of the work to
the user, and build it; nothing goes in `docs/plans/`, which no longer exists.

## Step 0: Split the request before writing any code

Do this first, on the request as stated. Most requests worth making are several changes
wearing one sentence, and the split is only cheap now — once the code exists, separating it
means branch surgery nobody wants to do, so the usual outcome is that nobody does it.

The cost of not splitting is not style, it is rebase tax, and it compounds. The merge queue
pays the mechanical half for you — a green check no longer goes stale because master moved —
but not the half that hurts: conflict reconciliation. Five PRs landed under Plan 17's single
four-step branch, and reconciling one branch against them took longer than all four features
took to write. Each of those four steps would have merged in minutes on its own. The tax is
superlinear — twice the branch against twice the drift is four times the conflict — and
every hour of it is spent re-deciding questions already answered.

So cut the request into the smallest pieces that each stand alone, and ship each as its own
PR: finish the first, run this process end to end, then start the second from the merged
master.

- **A piece stands alone when it builds, `check` passes, and nothing merged is broken by
  it** — even if the feature it belongs to is not yet whole. A capability behind an unset
  flag, a domain type nothing calls yet, an engine with no provider on top: all mergeable.
- **Keep pieces together only when splitting would land something broken** — a protocol
  change and the only caller that speaks it, a rename and its call sites.
- **Bump the version once, on the piece that earns it.** Four PRs is still one feature; the
  marker goes on the commit that actually moves the contract, not on each slice.
- **Say the split before you start**, in a sentence or two — what lands first, what follows,
  and what each one is good for on its own. State it and proceed; this is a routine judgement
  call, not a question. But a split that DROPS or defers something the user asked for is a
  scope change, and that goes through the Step 1 gate instead: say so and wait.

**Independent pieces run in parallel, not queued behind each other.** When the split yields
pieces that touch disjoint code with no ordering between them, put each on its own branch off
master and enable auto-merge on all of them at once: the queue re-tests each against real
master, so none waits for another to land. Keep a strict order only where one piece would break
without another already in — a rule and the sites it would reject, a protocol change and its
only caller, an analyzer and the tree it judges. Serialising independent PRs behind a single
branch buys nothing the queue does not already give, and costs a merge cycle apiece.

If you find yourself with several finished pieces on one branch anyway, do not bundle them
out of sympathy for the work already done — open the PR for what is there, and split the
NEXT request properly.

## Merge semantics: the queue

`master` merges through a **merge queue**, not directly, and squash is the only method.

- **A moving master costs you nothing now.** Branches are not required to be up to date, and
  a green check does not go stale when someone else lands first — the queue re-tests your
  change against real master itself. Rebase only for a genuine conflict.
- **Enabling auto-merge enqueues; it does not merge.** The queue builds base+PR on a
  temporary ref and runs `test` there via `pr.yaml`'s `merge_group` trigger.
- **Never infer merged-ness from a check conclusion — in either direction.** Grouping is
  `HEADGREEN`, so a batch can merge on its LAST entry's checks and carry a red one in with
  it; and an entry that fails, or never reports inside 60 minutes, is dropped from the queue
  and its PR quietly returns to open with auto-merge off. Read
  `gh pr view <n> --json state,mergedAt,mergeStateStatus` and believe that instead.
- **Silence is not progress.** A dropped entry produces no failure event. If a PR has neither
  merged nor failed by your next check-in, assume ejection and re-enqueue.
- **`autoMergeRequest` reads `null` while a PR is IN the queue.** It is not proof the PR left
  it. Read the queue: `gh api graphql -f query='{ repository(owner:"trinketworks",
  name:"yession"){ mergeQueue(branch:"master"){ entries(first:10){ nodes{
  pullRequest{number} state position } } } } }'`. An entry whose run failed sticks as
  `UNMERGEABLE` and `gh pr merge --auto` answers "already queued"; clear it with the
  `dequeuePullRequest` then `enqueuePullRequest` mutations on the PR's node id.
- **One push can carry several PRs**, so the `release` run in Step 4 may be a batch head that
  contains your commit rather than a run named for it.
- **A stacked PR goes DIRTY when the one under it squash-merges.** B's history holds A's
  original commit, which conflicts with A's squash. `git rebase --onto origin/master
  <A-sha>` and force-push; arm B's auto-merge only after A lands, or B's squash carries A's
  diff. If B already entered the queue its branch is locked (push refused, GH006) and it
  merges as-is — leave it.
- **PR CI checks out master+PR**, so a branch that builds locally can fail CI on a file
  master added after you branched. Fetch and rebase before diagnosing.

## Step 1: Compare what you built to what was asked

Re-read the request — the user's own words, plus the shape you told them you would build in
Step 0 — and diff it against what actually exists. You're looking for **interesting
deviations**, anything the person who asked would be surprised by:

- Approach changed (different design, different files, different mechanism than you said)
- Scope changed (asked-for items dropped, unasked-for behaviour added)
- Blockers hit, or work that turned out uncompletable
- Public behaviour differs from what was promised

NOT interesting (proceed without asking): mechanical differences — renames, small
refactors the code forced, correcting a mistaken assumption in the request, test
scaffolding nobody enumerated in advance.

**If there are interesting deviations, blockers, or uncompletable work: STOP.** Report
them to the user and wait. Do not open a PR — the user decides whether the deviation is
acceptable. Autonomous integration is only for work that matches what was asked for.

If consistent: proceed. No need to ask.

## Step 2: Verify locally, then open the PR

1. Run the checks this box can run before pushing — at minimum `check` inside devenv
   (see AGENTS.md Testing for capability tiers). Don't outsource the first failure to CI.
2. Commit on the session's designated feature branch, push with `git push -u origin <branch>`.
3. Open a PR against `master` (`mcp__github__create_pull_request`). Its description becomes
   the squashed commit body, so write it as one: summarize what this piece does and, where
   it is one of several, what it stands alone as and what follows it. A `+semver:` marker,
   if the change earns one, goes here on a line of its own — branch commit messages are
   discarded at merge and never reach master. Wrap the description at 72 columns; GitHub
   re-wraps anything wider.
4. Enable auto-merge: `mcp__github__enable_pr_auto_merge` (squash). Under the queue this
   enqueues the PR when it is otherwise ready — see Merge semantics above. There is no
   manual-merge fallback: direct merges to `master` are blocked by the ruleset.
5. Subscribe to the PR: `subscribe_pr_activity`. Then end the turn — events wake the
   session; never poll with sleep.

## Step 3: Watch PR CI through to merge

The PR pipeline is `.github/workflows/pr.yaml`. **Read the tier out of that file rather than
from here** — it is one line in the workflow, it grows as capabilities become cheap enough to
gate every PR on, and a copy of it in this skill went stale within two features. A local run
at a SMALLER tier than CI's is not "what CI runs": suites are gated on the capabilities they
need, so the ones CI declares and you did not are the ones you will not have run.

- **CI green + auto-merge fires → enqueued, then merged.** Go to Step 4.
- **Ejected from the queue →** not a CI failure and it raises no event. Diagnose the queue
  entry's own `test` run, fix if it was yours, and re-enqueue.
- **CI fails →** diagnose from the logs (`mcp__github__get_job_logs`), reproduce locally
  where the capability tiers allow, fix, and repeat this process from Step 1: the fix is
  itself a change, so re-compare it to what was asked. A mechanical fix (lint, missed test
  update, flaky infra) is not an interesting deviation — push it and keep going. A fix
  that would change the approach or scope IS one — stop and report instead.
- Keep looping until merged. One fix round is not the task; each new failure gets the
  same treatment.

## Step 4: Watch the master pipeline

Merging is not the finish line — `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs the full `verify`
gate (plus Docker/LiveAgent tiers PRs can't run) on every master push, and that's what
publishes the release. Your merge can break master in ways PR CI couldn't see.

PR webhooks stop at merge, so watch master actively:

1. Find the `release` workflow run for the merge commit (`mcp__github__actions_list` /
   `actions_get`).
2. If it's still running, schedule a `send_later` check-in (~15–30 min) and end the turn;
   on wake, re-check and re-arm until it concludes. Never busy-wait.
3. **Success →** done. Unsubscribe from the PR if still subscribed, tell the user the
   change is merged and released.
4. **Failure →** treat it as yours until proven otherwise. Diagnose, fix on a fresh
   branch restarted from latest master, and repeat the whole contributing-changes
   process from Step 1 for the fix — same deviation gate applies: mechanical fixes flow
   through autonomously; anything needing an interesting deviation from the original
   request stops and gets reported. If the failure demonstrably predates the merge
   (reproduces on the parent commit), report that to the user instead of blind-fixing.

## Definition of done

Merged to master — confirmed from the PR's merge state, not from a green check — AND the
master `release` pipeline is green for (or after) the merge commit. Anything short of that,
the loop is still running — either an event subscription or a scheduled check-in must be
armed before ending the turn.
