// Everything GitHub-specific about a session's pull requests, and nothing else — the

// and never learns which service it brokered, so a REST endpoint has no business above
// this file. What is left here is the endpoints and their JSON — the two a look reads
// (`fetchOver`, the whole of the `FetchPr` seam this side owns), and the two that open one
// (`openOver`: the list that keeps a repeated ask a question, then the create) — and the one
// field path a delivery names its repo at. The cadence, the ETag bookkeeping, the verbs and
// the query are provider-neutral and live in `PrWatches.fs`; a second forge is a second copy
// of this file, not a second poller.
