module Yession.Host.Assets

// The static asset service: the files a build ships, read once and served by path, by whichever
// process is running. Both bins use it — the Session Process for the client shell, the Manager
// for its own page — and neither one names a single asset.
//
// That ignorance is the point. A session may be upgraded on its own (`--spawn-bin`
// points at a floating install, Plan 11) and can then bring a typeface, a stylesheet, an image
// that the Manager beside it has never heard of. Nothing here has to learn about it: the
// directory the build left is the whole contract, and the route (`SessionRoute.Asset`) names a
// path and nothing else.
//
// The digest addresses the SET, not each file. One address for the whole directory is what lets
// a stylesheet reference a face by a plain relative name — `url(fonts/x.woff2)` inside
// `assets/<build>/app.css` resolves to `assets/<build>/fonts/x.woff2` — so nothing rewrites CSS
// at build time and nothing has to agree about naming. Immutability holds all the same: any
// byte of any file changes the digest, which changes every address in the set.
