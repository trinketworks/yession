module Yession.Host.Sandboxes

// The sandbox backends behind the `CreateSandbox` seam. Every decision — backend
// choice, environment assembly, policy construction — is a pure F# function here,
// unit-testable in the cheap tier; the `[<Emit>]` blocks below stay dumb (spawn, wire
// streams, kill) and never decide anything.
//
// The host backend passes the policy env to the child VERBATIM: no backend ever merges
// `process.env` into a spawned command again — that merge (the old Manager-side
// LocalProcessBackend) is exactly how `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` leaked into every
// agent-issued command.
