module Yession.Host.Version

// What build am I? Both bins answer this — over `--version`, and across the spawn handshake — so
// a running Yession is never anonymous.
//
// The version is a COMPILE-TIME constant: `tasks.fsx stage` passes esbuild
// `--define:YESSION_BUILD_VERSION="<version>"` when it bundles `manager.js` and `session.js`, so
// the identifier `Fable.NodeExtras.Bundle.buildVersion` reads is substituted for a literal.
// Nothing is read from disk at run time — the bundles deliberately never depend on a
// package.json being next to them.
//
// Every build states what it actually is; there are no placeholder versions:
//   1.0.0-beta.95   a release (GitVersion, see GitVersion.yml)
//   0.0.0-g1a2b3c4  a pure Nix build — .git is stripped from its source, so it reports its rev
//   test            the test tiers (`check` stages with this)
//   dev             an unbundled run of the Fable output (`tasks.fsx start` / `dev`)
