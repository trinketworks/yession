module Yession.Host.ProcessManager

// The Manager as a process supervisor (Phase 4, Step 23): sessions are child OS
// processes, so a crashing session can never take the Manager or its siblings down.
// The durable registry lives behind ManagerStore (Step 22); runtime state (child
// handle, port) is memory-only and reconciled at boot — after a Manager restart every
// session is simply stopped, and RESUME IS JUST LAUNCH: spawning over the same data
// directory replays the event log and doc sidecar (Step 19).
//
// Not a singleton by assumption: everything lives under this instance's data
// directory and session ports default to OS-assigned. Two Managers over the SAME data
// directory are unsupported (documented; a lock arrives with SQLite).
