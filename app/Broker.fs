module Yession.Host.Broker

// The Manager's connection broker (Plan 08): standards-only OAuth over the encrypted
// secret store. Sessions drive it over the control channel with the provider's
// endpoints AS DATA (authorize/token URL, client id, scopes) — the broker never learns
// which service it brokered; its one owned constant is its own public redirect URI on
// the Manager's fixed port (session ports are OS-assigned, nothing stable to pin a
// provider's registered redirect URI to). PKCE, the code exchange, and refresh all
// happen HERE: refresh tokens never reach a session process, and the single Manager
// refresher means providers that rotate refresh tokens on use never see two racing
// refreshes for one stored credential.
