module Yession.Host.Emulator

// The Session Process's terminal emulator (Plan 13, stage 2b): `@xterm/headless`, which is
// the same emulator the browser renders with minus the DOM.
//
// That sameness is the point. The Process has to answer three questions about a terminal —
// what the screen looks like for a peer joining mid-session, whether a foreground program
// has taken the alternate screen, and where OSC 133 marks fall — and answering them with a
// second, home-grown interpretation of ANSI would mean two implementations that agree until
// they do not, with the disagreement showing up as a screen that reads differently on two
// people's machines. Stage 1's pure-F# SGR parser is not a competitor here: it renders a
// STREAM of block output, which is a different job from maintaining a SCREEN, and it stays
// where it is.
//
// Bindings are hand-written `[<Import>]`/`[<Emit>]` over the small surface actually used —
// the `ProseMirror.fs` precedent, and the repo invariant that the platform boundary is
// interop rather than authored JS.

// The two packages ship differently, and this module is bundled for BOTH platforms — Node
// for the Session Process, and esbuild-for-the-browser since the client composes a live
// screen with the same emulator (Plan 14, stage 6). So each import has to be the form that
// resolves under both, and they are not the same form.
//
// `@xterm/headless` is a DEFAULT import: its `main` is a CommonJS bundle and it declares no
// `exports` map, so Node resolves an ESM `import` to that CJS file and offers only the
// default — a named `import { Terminal }` fails at load with "does not provide an export
// named 'Terminal'". Its `module` field names `lib/xterm.mjs` (the browser build), which is
// not shipped in the package, so a bundler falls back to the same CJS main.

// `@xterm/addon-serialize` is a NAMED import, and the difference cost a red release job.
// It ships BOTH `main` (CJS) and `module` (`lib/addon-serialize.mjs`, which exists and
// exports `SerializeAddon` by name and nothing by default). Node resolves the CJS and its
// interop invents a default, so `ImportDefault` worked here for as long as this file was
// Node-only; esbuild prefers `module` for the browser, where that default does not exist —
// "No matching export ... for import default", and only when bundling the real client
// entry, which no test tier short of `stage` does. The named export is present in both
// builds, so this is the one spelling that resolves everywhere.
