module Yession.Host.SecretStore

// The Manager's secret store (Plan 06): the pure `SecretsFile` envelope behind the
// `SecretsCodec`, values as per-entry AES-GCM ciphertext under a KEK the OS credential
// manager holds (KeyStore). One code path serves both modes: `Some path` = durable
// (encrypted file in the Manager's data dir, ManagerStore-style atomic writes);
// `None` = ephemeral (no credential manager on this host — no file I/O at all, a
// per-boot random KEK, everything dies with the Manager). `Resolve` feeds environment
// injection only, and with session-owned sandboxes that injection happens at the
// SESSION'S sandbox spawn: a value crosses only the authenticated loopback control
// channel (`/control/secrets/resolve`, gated by the readable-scope walk below), only
// at sandbox spawn, and never reaches the agent loop.
