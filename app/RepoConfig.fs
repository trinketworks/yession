module Yession.Host.RepoConfig

// The bridge between a `yession.yaml` on disk and `ConfigFile` in the domain (Plan 27).
//
// Deliberately the thinnest thing that can work, because everything worth testing lives on
// the other side of it: `Yession.Domain.ConfigFile` decodes an already-parsed tree, so it
// runs in the cheap tier on both runtimes from JSON literals. This module is the part that
// cannot — it reads a file and calls a JS parser — and it is kept small enough that its own
// failure modes are the only thing left to get wrong.
//
// YAML is a superset of JSON, so the parse hands the decoder a JSON tree and nothing about
// the schema knows which surface syntax it came from. Changing that syntax later is a change
// to this file alone.

/// Everything the parser objected to, as messages.

/// `parse` would not do: it RESOLVES what it can and reports the rest as warnings it then
/// discards, so a file carrying a tag the schema does not define comes back as an ordinary
/// value and decodes as though the tag had never been written. `parseDocument` keeps the
/// complaints, which is what lets an unrecognised tag be a refusal rather than a silent
/// downgrade.

/// `schema: "core"` is YAML's own JSON-compatible schema and nothing more, so the only tags
/// it resolves are the ones JSON could have expressed; anything else becomes a complaint
/// above. `uniqueKeys` turns a repeated key into an error rather than a silent last-wins fold
/// — which is what makes the domain's "declared twice" refusal reachable from a real file,
/// since JSON object semantics would have folded the duplicate before the decoder saw it.
/// `maxAliasCount` bounds alias expansion, so an anchor referring to itself cannot turn a
/// small file into an unbounded tree.
///
/// Anchors themselves are deliberately allowed: `&base` / `*base` resolve before the decoder
/// sees anything, so reuse inside a file costs the schema nothing.
