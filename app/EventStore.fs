module Yession.Host.EventStore

// A durable event log: an append-only JSONL file behind the same `EventLog` capability
// as the in-memory implementation, so callers cannot tell the difference. One line per
// envelope, written synchronously on append (local-first, single writer — the Session
// Process). The log lives with the Session Process on Node, so durability is a file,
// not a browser store: browser clients already recover by offset catch-up (Step 07).
