module Yession.Host.GitHubConnection

// Everything GitHub-specific about signing in (Plan 14) lives HERE, in the session —
// exactly the ClaudeConnection precedent. GitHub's token exchange for the
// authorization-code grant demands the App's client SECRET, which the Manager's
// standards-only public-client broker deliberately cannot carry — so this connection
// uses the DEVICE FLOW instead (client id only, no secret anywhere): the session asks
// github.com for a user code, the human approves it in their own browser, and the
// session polls the token endpoint until the grant lands. What that produces is a whole
// authorization rather than a bare string, so it is stored through the broker's GRANT leg
// (`PutGrant` → `BrokeredOAuth`, Plan 21): the refresh token stays Manager-side and the
// access token rotates before the turns that need it. The Manager still never learns which
// service it stored. The paste leg remains for a PAT, which genuinely is a bare string.
//
// The token is a GitHub App user-to-server token: what it can reach is the
// intersection of the USER's access and the APP's installations — which is the
// "repos must be covered by the App installation" rule, enforced by the credential
// itself rather than by any check written here. A pasted PAT bypasses that rule
// (documented in GAPS).
