module Yession.Host.WebRtc

// The WebRTC carrier for the session transport: a `FrameChannel` over a libdatachannel
// data channel, plus the offer/answer signalling primitives. The connection is
// established with a non-trickle exchange — each side waits for ICE gathering to complete
// (an event), then exchanges a single complete SDP — so there are no candidate-timing
// races and nothing depends on sleeps. See docs/design.md §2.3.
