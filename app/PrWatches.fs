module Yession.Host.PrWatches

// Watching a pull request, with nothing in it that names a forge. The Domain says what a
// pull request IS (`PrFacts.fs`) and what its movement MEANS (`PrWatches.fs`); this says
// how a session keeps looking: the cadence, the ETag bookkeeping, the in-flight guard, the
// verbs that start and stop a watch, and the query all of it reads back through.
//
// The whole provider surface is two functions — `FetchPr`, one look, and `OpenPr`, one
// pull request opened — plus a `provider` label the error copy is written around, because
// "github rejected this credential" is a sentence a person has to read and "the provider
// rejected this credential" is not. A second forge is a second `fetchOver`, a second
// `openOver` and a second hook filter (`GitHubPrs.fs` is the first), and nothing in this
// file changes to admit it.
//
// Polling, not webhooks, and that is a decision rather than a stopgap: a repo webhook
// needs admin on every repo somebody wants watched, and inbound delivery needs a
// deployment the provider can reach — which the loopback default is not. A settled watch
// costs two conditional GETs that both answer 304, which is free (GitHub does not count
// one against the rate limit), and it works in every deployment shape there is. `FetchPr`
// is where a future push transport plugs in without anything downstream noticing.
