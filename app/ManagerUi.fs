module Yession.Host.ManagerUi

// The management UI (Phase 4, Step 25): a deliberately server-side-rendered admin surface
// — list sessions with live status, create, launch/resume, stop, open. Pure F# render
// functions produce full pages and FRAGMENTS from Fable.Lit templates (rendered to strings
// by our own `Ssr` wrapper — no client bundle, no Elmish, no Yjs); a tiny inline vanilla
// script swaps the fragments on create/launch/stop and takes live status from an SSE stream
// of rendered tables (`GET /sessions/rows`) — the server pushes, the page never polls. It
// shares the session client's `Style` (the same locally served /app.css), and — being
// online-only — is the natural home for server-side Lit SSR. This is not the collaborative
// client; it shares the Manager's 127.0.0.1 endpoint with the control RPC.
