module Yession.Host.TranscriptStore

// Per-terminal transcripts (Plan 13): one append-only asciicast file per terminal, held
// under the session's data directory as `terminals/<id>.cast`.
//
// Same discipline as the event log and the doc sidecar, because it is the same promise:
// write + fsync before returning, so a record is durable before anyone is told about it.
// The difference is what a torn tail means. A torn event line is dropped, because the
// append was never acknowledged and the log must stay decodable. A torn transcript line
// is dropped for the same reason — but the DROP is not silent: the line count is what
// every sequence number is measured in, so a transcript that quietly lost its last line
// would renumber everything after it. Truncating the file back to its last whole line at
// open keeps line index and sequence number the same thing, for ever.
//
// A terminal's file outlives the process that wrote it. Reopening an existing transcript
// appends to it and continues its numbering; the header is written once, when the file is
// created. An audit trail that restarts at zero is not one.
