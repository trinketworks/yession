module Yession.Host.ManagerCli

// What `yession-manager` accepts, as a VALUE rather than as statements inside the bin.
//
// It lives here rather than in `Main.fs` because two things need it and they must not be
// able to disagree. `Main.fs` reads each option to build the Manager; `Retirements` names
// options as the fix for variables that moved, and a retirement pointing at an option this
// bin does not declare would send an operator to a flag the parser refuses. That is a rule
// over BOTH lists, so it needs a place where both are reachable — and the composition root
// is the one place a test cannot go.
//
// It cost a red build to learn: the check existed, but against a hand-copied list of the
// options, so the first retirement added afterwards broke it. A copy that must be updated in
// lockstep is not a check, it is a second list.

/// Every option, in the order `--help` prints them.
