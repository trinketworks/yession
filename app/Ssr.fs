module Yession.Host.Ssr

// Our own dependency-free server-side renderer for Fable.Lit templates. A lit-html
// `TemplateResult` is `{ strings, values }`: the static markup parts interleaved with the
// hole values. Rendering to a string is just that interleave — recursing into nested
// templates and arrays, escaping text, and dropping the bindings a string can't carry
// (event/property/boolean holes, `@ . ?`). Because it never parses HTML, it handles
// `<textarea>` child-text bindings that @lit-labs/ssr miscounts, and because it pulls no
// dependencies it bundles trivially into the shipped single-file executable — no CDN, no
// parse5. The browser renders the same templates live; this is the first paint.
