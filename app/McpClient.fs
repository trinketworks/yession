// The session as an MCP client (Plan 17, step 3).
//
// Plan 16 settled that the SESSION talks to a declared server, not the Manager, and this is
// that half. It is an ordinary MCP client over Streamable HTTP — deliberately ordinary,
// because the point of the whole plan is that a provider can be anyone's. Nothing here is
// Yession-shaped except which servers it is pointed at.
//
// The split follows the repo's existing one: the envelopes are Thoth codecs in the Domain
// (testable with no socket), and what lives here is the POSTing, the header bookkeeping and
// the connection lifecycle. That is the same division `Sse.fs` draws.
