module Yession.Host.Queries

// The query registry (Plan 15): the ONE place a read-only view of session state is
// declared, projected to two audiences that never see each other's projection.
//
//   agent  ◄── MCP tools, generated from `Definitions` + `Read`, carrying `readOnlyHint`
//   human  ◄── one multiplexed SSE stream, rendered by one generic settings component
//
// The asymmetry with COMMANDS is the point. A command mutates and only the agent runs
// one — a human who wants something changed asks, and the mutation lands as an attributed
// event in the timeline. A query reads, and everybody gets it, because verifying what the
// agent did should not cost a conversation turn.
//
// Nothing here knows what a repo or a sandbox is: a registration is a declaration plus a
// thunk, so the capability that owns the state owns the answer, and adding a query is one
// value in SessionMain rather than a panel, a route, a message and a reducer case.
