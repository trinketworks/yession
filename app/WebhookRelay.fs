module Yession.Host.WebhookRelay

// The Manager's hook relay: opaque bytes in, signature verified, matched against whatever
// filters sessions declared, forwarded to those sessions. It never learns which service
// sent a delivery, what the event means, or what any field is called — a session names the
// paths it cares about (`Yession.Domain.Hooks`) and this module resolves them without
// understanding them.
//
// That ignorance is for MINIMALITY, not containment: a smaller Manager is a smaller single
// point of failure, and a session that does not need the Manager to learn its provider can
// be upgraded on its own. Sessions are trusted — they already hold the credentials they
// would act on — so the Manager verifies the DELIVERY, which arrives from the internet, and
// takes a session's word on the SUBSCRIPTION, which arrives over the authenticated control
// channel from a child it spawned.
//
// The secret is derived, never stored. An operator chooses a webhook secret when they
// register the App (GitHub says so: "type a string to use as a secret key"), so the Manager
// generates one and the operator pastes it in — nothing to find, nothing to record, no
// plaintext secret in the state file. Deriving it from the KEK the credential manager
// already holds is what makes it survive a restart without being written anywhere.
