module Yession.Host.OperatorResources

// The operator's vocabulary, read off disk and shown back to them.
//
// Two halves of one story, deliberately in one file: the bridge that turns a file into a
// `ResourceProfile`, and the query that says what that profile MEANS. A profile is the first
// thing in this system an operator authors that has a non-obvious consequence — a name can
// reach other names, and what it finally grants is a closure rather than what is written
// beside it — so being able to read the answer back is not a nicety.
//
// Nothing consumes the profile yet. That is the point of it landing this way round: an
// operator can write one, see its closures, and find the cycle or the contradiction, before
// anything at all depends on what it says.
//
// The bridge is the thinnest thing that can work, for the reason `RepoConfig` gives: the
// schema lives in `Yession.Domain.Sandboxes.OperatorProfile`, decodes an already-parsed tree,
// and runs in the cheap tier on both runtimes. This part reads a file and calls a JS parser,
// and it is kept small enough that its own failure modes are all that is left to get wrong.

/// denies reading the symlink NODES that an access traverses on the way in: macOS's escape
/// hatch is `file-read-metadata` on DIRECTORIES only, and `/etc`, `/tmp` and `/run` are all
/// symlinks there. So `/etc/ssl/cert.pem` is granted at `/private/etc/ssl/cert.pem` and
/// denied at the path it was written as. Measured, not deduced: a sandbox holding exactly
/// that resource reads the canonical path and is refused the written one.
///
/// Refused rather than rewritten, and that is the whole decision. Silently canonicalising
/// would fix the mount and leave the `SSL_CERT_FILE` beside it pointing at the denied path —
/// a resource half-corrected is worse than one that failed, because the failure moves to
/// whatever reads the variable. The operator writes both lines, so the refusal has to reach
/// the operator, naming the form to write.

/// A path that does not resolve is left alone. A cache directory a tool has yet to create is
/// ordinary, and refusing it here would be an existence check wearing this rule's name.
