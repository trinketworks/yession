module Yession.Host.Repos

// The session's repo manager (Plan 14, resurfaced by Plan 15): the agent's MCP verbs
// land here, every mutation appends an attributed event, and the conversation timeline
// is the record everyone reads.
//
// Plan 14 gave this a second, symmetric interface — a panel that could drive every verb.
// Plan 15 retired that half: a human who wants a repo added asks the agent, so there is
// one authorization path, one set of inputs to validate, and one place the act is
// recorded. What the panel is left with is the LISTING, which is now the `repos` query
// at the foot of this file. The cost was weighed and taken: with no working agent, nobody
// can add a repo at all. That is acceptable because it is the same session in which nothing
// else works either — and a panel button kept "just in case" would restore the second
// authorization path, the second set of inputs to validate, and the second place a
// mutation's record can go missing.
//
// Git itself runs through the sandbox seam under the AGENT backend (`host` is the
// explicitly lax choice; `srt` confines each spawn to the repos directory and the
// allowlisted egress). CLONE is the one exception, and it is a whole sandbox rather
// than a flag on a spawn: it writes a work tree whose names are the repo's, and srt
// refuses some of those names anywhere on the disk. See `unconfined` below.
// On top of the confinement, repo-controlled EXECUTION is disabled
// per invocation — hooks, fsmonitor, ext transport — because the WorkSandbox can write
// the repos directory by design, so a poisoned `.git/config` is assumed and made inert
// rather than trusted-by-placement.
//
// The credential (the acting human's GitHub token, Plan 08 precedence) reaches exactly
// one place: the env of the single confined git invocation that needs it. It is never
// in the sandbox policy env, so nothing that outlives the invocation can read it.
