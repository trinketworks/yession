module Yession.Host.Agent

// The real agent runner: an adapter from the `RunAgent` capability to the Claude Agent
// SDK. The turn's typed capabilities reach the model as MCP tools, and WHICH tools those
// are is no longer this file's business — `AgentTools.registry` answers that, and the
// adapter turns whatever it answers into `sdk.tool(...)` calls in a loop (Plan 16, part A).
// Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN; the deterministic tests never call
// this, and the live smoke test is gated on credentials, so verification stays repeatable.
