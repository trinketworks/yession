module Yession.Host.ClaudeConnection

// Everything Claude-specific lives HERE, in the session — the Manager's broker is
// standards-only and never learns which service it brokered, and nothing above this file
// knows which provider answered. This module owns: the Anthropic OAuth endpoints and
// Claude Code's public client id (sent to the broker as data), the reserved storage name,
// pasted-token classification, the credential→env-var mapping the Agent SDK consumes, the
// models lookup behind the session's provider-neutral catalogue, and the browser-facing
// /claude* routes the client panel drives.
