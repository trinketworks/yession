module Yession.Host.RepoSandboxes

// The fold: every configured repo's `yession.yaml`, into the commands the session already
// has (Plan 27).
//
// There is no executor here and deliberately no second policy engine. Plan 15 made every
// mutating command ENSURE-SHAPED specifically so this could be a fold rather than a
// runner: a declaration becomes one `start_work_sandbox`, put through the same gate the
// agent's goes through, and asking twice for what is already running changes nothing and
// records nothing. So convergence is a property of the commands, not of anything written
// here — and re-folding is free, which is what lets it run at boot and after every verb
// that changes what checkouts exist.
//
// What this DOES own is the part no command can: which files there are, which of them could
// be read, and what happened to each declaration. A fold that silently did nothing for a
// repo whose file has a typo would be the exact failure the schema's strict decoding exists
// to avoid, one layer up.
//
// It never stops anything. A declaration that disappears leaves its sandbox running and
// marked as no longer declared: convergence that kills somebody's build is not convergence
// (`WorkSandboxes.fs`), and removal stays `stop_work_sandbox`.
