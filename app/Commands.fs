module Yession.Host.Commands

// The session's gated COMMANDS, both halves in one place (Plan 14, Plan 15 stage 2/3b).
//
// A gated command is two functions that only make sense together: the one a turn calls,
// which encodes the arguments and hands them to the gate, and the one the GATE calls once a
// verdict is in, which decodes those same arguments and carries the act out. They are joined
// by nothing but a string — the tool name — and by the encoding of the argument list, so a
// rename or a re-ordering on one side is a runtime failure on the other.
//
// Both used to live in `SessionMain.fs`, which is an entry: it has top-level effects, so
// nothing may reference it and no test can reach what it holds. The pair therefore had the
// shape the colocation rule warns about — a decision taken in the composition root, where the
// cheap tier cannot see it. They are here, beside each other, so a harness can drive a tool
// call against the SAME bindings a turn uses rather than against a re-statement of them.
//
// What stays in the entry is composition: which services exist, and handing the table to the
// gate the Host owns.
//
// Every command here is ENSURE-shaped: re-running one with the same arguments converges on the
// same state, records nothing, and says so. That is not politeness — the declarative form of
// this API is a fold of a config file into these commands on every boot, so a command that
// accumulated instead of converging would clone a repo twice, or restart a sandbox somebody is
// working in, each time the session came up. `add_repo` answers with the current listing when
// the checkout is already there; `start_work_sandbox` hands back the running sandbox and
// refuses only when the configuration differs.
