module Yession.Browser.Screens

// The live terminal screen, in the browser (Plan 14, stage 6).
//
// A terminal in live mode is running a program that moves the cursor, so what it DISPLAYS is
// a projection of what it emitted — not the stream itself. The client therefore needs an
// emulator, and it uses the SAME one the Session Process does (`@xterm/headless`, driven
// through `Emulator.fs`'s contract): fed the same bytes in the same order AT THE SAME SIZE,
// the two screens cannot disagree, which is the property `TerminalSnapshot` rests on and
// which a second, browser-only renderer would quietly break.
//
// The size is half of that sentence and used to be missing from it. This opened every
// emulator at 80x24 and never resized one, while the Process resized both its pty and its own
// emulator on every viewport report — so a wide pane rewrapped every line at 80 columns and a
// program drawing 40 rows spilled its frame into scrollback, under a comment promising the
// two could not disagree. The snapshot now carries the geometry it was painted at, and a
// resize record reshapes the emulator exactly as it reshaped the pty.
//
// The emulator is a live object, so it lives here rather than in the model. What reaches the
// model is its SERIALIZATION — the same form a snapshot travels in — which the view renders
// through the ANSI spans a block's output already uses.
//
//   snapshot(seq, screen)  ->  reset the emulator to that screen, remember seq
//   record(n > seq)        ->  write it, advance seq
//   after either           ->  serialize and dispatch
//
// Composability comes from the seq, exactly as it does for events: the snapshot may be NEWER
// than its seq (the screen is read after the position is taken), which is the safe direction
// — a record already drawn is drawn again, and drawing it twice is idempotent, whereas a seq
// ahead of the screen would skip a record for ever.
