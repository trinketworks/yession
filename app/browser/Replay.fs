module Yession.Browser.Replay

// The asciinema replay view's platform half (Plan 13, stage 3e).
//
// A closed terminal's blocks survive in the projection, but a list of commands is not the
// same artefact as the RECORDING — a replay shows the terminal as it behaved, at the speed it
// behaved, which is what someone auditing actually wants to watch.
//
// `asciinema-player` rather than the client's own renderer, and it earns itself. PR 1's
// pure-F# SGR parser (`Ansi.fs`) renders a STREAM, not a SCREEN, so a recording of anything
// that moves the cursor — `htop`, a progress bar, `vim` — would replay as garbage. That is the
// same argument the plan made for why the Session Process needed a real emulator rather than
// half of one, and it is why the sidecar was written as asciicast v2 in the first place: so
// the standard player replays it. The player also brings timing, seek and play/pause, which
// IS the audit-read affordance.
//
// Bindings are hand-written `[<Import>]`/`[<Emit>]` over the small surface used — the
// `Emulator.fs` / `ProseMirror.fs` precedent, and the repo invariant that the platform
// boundary is interop rather than authored JS.

/// the shape the terminal actually was) while scaling to the panel.

/// `startAt` and `poster` are the player's own options (Plan 14, stage 4), which is why a
