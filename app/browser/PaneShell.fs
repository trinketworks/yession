module Yession.Browser.PaneShell

// The bits of the pane that the model drives but a Lit render cannot do: moving focus, and
// the root class the column's open state is expressed as (Plan 13; Plan 14, stages 2 and 5).
//
// The chat and the pane are two columns, and tapping a chip in one puts something new in the
// other. Focus has to follow, or a keyboard user presses Enter on a chip and stays exactly
// where they were with no way of knowing anything happened. Closing that tab has the mirror
// problem: the control that was focused leaves the document.
//
// Its own module because two entry points need all of it — the app (`Browser.fs`) and the
// host-free shell harness the `Browser`-tier E2E drives. A second copy would be a second
// thing to keep correct, and the one that rotted would be the one nothing runs.
//
// Everything here waits a frame: the model changes first, Lit renders second, and `focus()`
// on an element that is not in the document yet is a no-op.
//
// This file used to be `[<Emit>]` bodies — a hundred-odd lines of JavaScript in strings, and
// most of it POLICY rather than binding: which element is stranded, how a tab key becomes a
// selector, what the splitter's bounds are. Emit bodies are inlined into whatever calls them,
// and Fable does not treat a change to one as a change to its callers, so editing this file
// silently left every compiled caller stale — a test failing for a reason its source does not
// contain, three runs of the browser tier before anybody looked at the bundle. Ordinary F# has
// none of that: it is a module, so what depends on it recompiles. What is genuinely a binding
// went to `Fable.BrowserExtras`; the rest is `Browser.Dom`, typed, and readable.
