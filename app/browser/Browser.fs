// The browser client entry: the same Elmish/Ylmish program as everywhere else, wired to

// libdatachannel; the protocol and signalling are identical). The shell is rendered by
// Fable.Lit — `View.view` into `#app` on every model change. Lit diffs the DOM, so focus,
// caret, and the collaborative textareas survive re-renders with no manual bookkeeping;
// interactive controls are inline template handlers, not attribute delegation.
