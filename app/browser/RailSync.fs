module Yession.Browser.RailSync

// The chapter rail's other half: where `Rail` says a stroke goes, this says what its inputs
// are. Measuring is all it does — the rail's box, and the top of every marked message — and
// then it writes one number per stroke as a custom property the stylesheet positions from.
//
// A custom property rather than a model field for the ordinary reason a pixel is never a
// fact about a session: the number changes on every scroll frame, and a model that carried it
// would re-render the whole conversation sixty times a second to move eight hairlines.
//
// Its own module, and before `Browser.fs`, because two entry points drive it: the app and the
// host-free shell harness the `Browser`-tier E2E runs against. A second copy would be a
// second thing to keep correct, and the one that rotted would be the one nothing runs.
