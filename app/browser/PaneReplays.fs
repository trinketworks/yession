module Yession.Browser.PaneReplays

// Keeping the mounted players in step with the model (Plan 13, stage 3e; Plan 14, stage 4).
//
// The view renders empty `[data-pane-replay="<tab key>"]` hosts and this attaches a player to
// each, because a `.cast` is a whole artefact rather than a value to bind and the player owns
// its own DOM once mounted. ONE mount path for all three kinds of recording — a whole
// terminal, a block's range, a stretch's — because they differ in what they play rather than
// in how they are mounted; the model turns the tab's key back into what to play.
//
// Its own module because two entry points drive it: the app (`Browser.fs`) and the host-free
// shell harness the `Browser`-tier E2E runs. A second copy would be a second thing to keep
// correct, and the one that rotted would be the one nothing runs.
