// The Manager entry point (`start`; the `yession` binary). The Manager is a
// process supervisor + management surface: sessions run as CHILD OS PROCESSES
// (`yession-session`; in development, node over the Fable output), so a crashing
// session never takes the Manager down.
//
// What this Manager DECIDES is said on its command line; what it PASSES DOWN stays in the
// environment, because inheritance is how a child gets it. So the addresses this deployment
// answers at (`YESSION_MANAGER_URL`, `YESSION_SESSION_URL`), the per-session policy
// (`YESSION_SESSION_*`) and the binaries a session runs (`YESSION_BIN_*`) are read from the
// environment here and by the session alike, while the port, the data directory, the idle
// window, the default session and the spawn command are options — nothing downstream reads
// them, and an option that is mistyped is refused where a variable that is mistyped is
// ignored.
//
// For product continuity a default session is ensured and launched at boot; creating,
// launching, resuming, and stopping further sessions arrives with the management UI
// (Step 25).
