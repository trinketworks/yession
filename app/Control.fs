module Yession.Host.Control

// The Manager's control endpoint (Phase 4, Step 24): the supervision + custody surface
// for its child Session Processes, across the process boundary. The child
// authenticates each call with its per-launch secret; 127.0.0.1 only. Environments and
// commands are session-owned (the sandbox seam) and never cross this channel — it
// carries secrets custody, connections, supervision reports, and ONE piece of session
// metadata: the session's self-assigned display name (a label, never conversation or
// event content), so the Manager's list reflects the title.
//
// Routes (secret in the `x-yession-control` header):
//   POST /control/name             { name }         -> "ok" (updates the registry display name)
//   POST /control/register-client  { redirectUri }  -> { clientId, clientSecret, issuer }
//   POST /control/secrets/set      { scope, name, value } -> secret metadata (never a value)
//   POST /control/secrets/list     { scope }        -> { secrets: metadata[] } (never values)
//   POST /control/secrets/delete   { scope, name }  -> { deleted }
//   POST /control/secrets/resolve  { name }         -> { value }
//        (the one value-returning SECRETS route: a session resolves the values its
//         sandbox spec references at sandbox spawn — gated by the caller's readable
//         scopes, the same walk Manager-side injection always used. The value crosses
//         only this authenticated loopback channel, only at sandbox spawn, and never
//         reaches the agent loop — there is still no agent-facing read capability.)
//   GET  /control/notifications                     -> text/event-stream (the reverse leg:
//        the Manager pushing notifications DOWN to this session, multiplexed as SSE frames
//        of `ControlWire.sessionNotification` JSON — see NotificationHub / SessionNotification)
//   GET  /control/mcp                               -> text/event-stream (a second reverse leg:
//        THIS session's resolved MCP server set on subscribe, then a fresh whole set on
//        every change, as SSE frames of `Codec.mcpServerSet` (Plan 17). The Manager says
//        WHERE the servers are; the session is the MCP client that talks to them.)
//   POST /control/connections/begin      ConnectionBeginRequest -> { authorizeUrl, state }
//   POST /control/connections/complete   { target, code }       -> "ok" (manual paste completion)
//   POST /control/connections/put        { target, value }      -> "ok" (static token)
//   POST /control/connections/put-grant  { target, accessToken, … } -> "ok" (refreshable)
//   POST /control/connections/disconnect { target }             -> { disconnected }
//   POST /control/connections/reject     { target, reason }     -> { recorded }
//   POST /control/connections/resolve    { target }             -> { kind, value }
//        (the ONE value-returning route (Plan 08): an agent turn needs the token
//         in-process; policy gates it to targets whose scope the caller is bound to)
//   POST /control/hooks/subscribe    { filter }     -> { id }
//   POST /control/hooks/unsubscribe  { id }         -> { dropped }
//        (the hook relay: what this session wants forwarded from the Manager's hook
//         endpoints. A filter is DATA — a conjunction of equalities over paths — because
//         code would make the Manager a version ceiling on the sessions it supervises.)
//   GET  /control/connections                       -> text/event-stream (a third reverse leg:
//        the caller's readable connection statuses on subscribe, then a fresh list on every
//        change — metadata frames of `ControlWire.connectionStatusList`, never values)
//
// Every launch can call the channel: its secret resolves to WHICH session is calling,
// and the secrets/connections handlers apply their own policy per call.
