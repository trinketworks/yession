module Yession.Host.Signalling

// HTTP serves static app bootstrap, temporary WebRTC signalling, and the read-only history
// surfaces — the event log and the terminal transcripts,
// both read by cursor. A client sends the position it has folded through
// (`/events/after/{n}`, `/terminals/{t}/after/{n}`) and this redirects to the range it chose
// (`/events/{first}-{last}`, `/terminals/{t}/{first}-{last}`), whose bounds do not move — so
// those bytes are the same for ever and a client can keep them, the growing tail included.
// Everything interactive stays
// on the data channel (design.md §2.3). `/signal` accepts a peer's offer and returns the
// Session Process's answer; the established data channel becomes a session `FrameChannel`.
