// --- Awaiting a promise ------------------------------------------------------
//
// Fable's async trampoline hijacks a workflow onto a `setTimeout` every 2000 steps, and
// `Async.AwaitPromise` attaches its rejection handler only once the workflow reaches the
// await. A promise that rejects inside that window has no handler when Node checks at the
// end of the turn, so Node kills the process — and a `try/with` around the await cannot
// help, because its handler is not attached yet. That is how a routine "no such
// container" 404, caught and ignored on every other run, killed the whole suite (the
// unhandled rejection of verify run 30725449198).
//
// `awaitPromise` settles the promise in JS, at creation, so both outcomes are a value the
// workflow may take as long as it likes to read. Every await in the Node host goes
// through it: one answer to the hazard rather than one per call site. (The browser keeps
// `Async.AwaitPromise` — an unhandled rejection there is a console warning, not a dead
// process, and this module is Node-only.)

    // created the promise, which is the only tick in which attaching a handler is
    // guaranteed to beat Node's check. Deferring it into the `async` would reproduce the
    // very gap this exists to close.
