module Yession.Host.DocStore

// Durable Yjs-document persistence (Phase 3, Step 19): a sidecar JSONL file next to the
// event log holding every doc update as one base64 line, so unsent collaborative state
// (queued messages, drafts) survives a process restart. Same discipline as the event
// log: write+fsync before returning (durability before visibility), torn-tail recovery
// for the final unacknowledged line, loud failure on real corruption. At open the file
// is replayed into the session doc (Yjs updates are idempotent and order-tolerant) and
// then COMPACTED to a single merged-state snapshot line.
