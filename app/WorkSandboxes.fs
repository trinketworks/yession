module Yession.Host.WorkSandboxes

// The session's WorkSandboxes, by name (Plan 15, stage 2).
//
// A session used to have exactly one environment, so it needed no name. Now the agent can
// ask for a `test` sandbox beside the `default` one — and asking twice returns the SAME
// one. That idempotence is the whole point: it is what lets the declarative form
// (`yession.yaml`, the follow-up plan) be nothing more than a fold of the file into these
// commands at boot, run on every boot, converging rather than accumulating.
//
// The rule when an ask does NOT match what is running is the interesting half. Same name,
// same configuration: hand back the running one and record nothing, because nothing
// happened. Same name, DIFFERENT configuration: refuse, and say what differs. Never
// recreate silently — a sandbox has processes in it, and "converging" by killing
// somebody's build is not convergence.
//
// Credential forwarding is named, never a flag. `forward = ["github"]` resolves that
// credential for the TURN HUMAN (Plan 08 precedence, applied by the composition) into the
// sandbox's policy env at spawn. The event records WHICH names and WHOSE — the value
// reaches the sandbox env and nothing else, and the event type cannot carry one.
