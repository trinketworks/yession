module Yession.Host.ShellProfile

// The `shell_profile` query (Plan 25): where a shell opened in each sandbox starts.
//
// Here rather than beside the projection, for the reason `Repos.query` and
// `WorkSandboxes.query` are where they are: `QueryRegistration` is a Host-layer type, and
// the Session Process — which owns the answer — cannot see it. What lives here is the
// declaration and the projection into rows; the state itself stays with the terminal
// manager, which is the only thing that can change it.
//
// One registration, two audiences: the agent gets a `readOnlyHint` MCP tool, and the
// people get a section on the generated settings surface. Nobody writes a panel.
